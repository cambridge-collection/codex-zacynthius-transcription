For every fruit has sprung from the substance of the<br/> fruit-bearing tree:  it is of the same nature as that,  and not from anything else. <br/> So,  he says,  how was the body of Emmanuel not from Mary?  Fool! <br/> You have rejected the womb which produced the blessed and true fruit, <br/> and you invent the appearance of some non-existent phantasm,  making the mother a<br/> ghost and our salvation a dream.  For if the woman who was taken from his rib and created<br/> was of the same substance as Adam,  and sin is derived from her as she<br/> offended with him in the transgression of the commandment,  the Virgin too<br/> was assuredly of the same substance.  From her,  Christ,  the second Adam,  has risen up,  who takes<br/> away the sin of the world,  so that “those who have died in Adam might be made alive in Christ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;/span&gt;">*</span></div><div class="column col-left"> as the Apostle<br/> says.❧ <br/><span class="centrejust"><span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Origen, Fragment 34 on Luke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=1452&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 1452&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From an unattributed source.❧ </span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 045-1&lt;/span&gt;">45</span></span> <span class="cap">S</span>he utters a sound in harmony</span></div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">1:43</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 46</span></span>And why has this happened to me,  that<br/> the mother of the Lord comes to me? </div><div class="column col-full"> with her son.

So<br/> on one hand the divine dispensation brought witness to Elizabeth,  so that the witness<br/> of John to the Lord even from the womb should be fulfilled.  Yet the visit of the Virgin to her relation<br/> had its own eagerness.  For she came to see Elizabeth and the miraculous<br/> embryo in her,  according to the speech of the angel,  so that through this,  childbirth<br/> was given greater credence.  And,  I say,  what came from the Virgin herself and what is consistent with<br/> this faith is the word of Elizabeth,  saying “And blessed is the she who believed that there would be<br/> a fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 1:45&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
