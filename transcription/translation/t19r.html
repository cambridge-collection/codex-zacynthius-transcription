For he first made the sons of Israel cross the Jordan,  and<br/> then straightaway he stopped them and circumcised them with stone knives.  Therefore<br/> when we have crossed the Jordan,  then Christ circumcises us in the power of the Spirit: <br/> he does not cleanse the flesh but rather cuts out the defilement in souls.  Accordingly, <br/> in us Christ circumcises and takes on his name (i.e.  Saviour),  as I have said.  For then, <br/> even then were we saved through him.❧ <br/><span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Severus of Antioch, Letter III.74 to Caesaria the Noblewoman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=7071&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 7071&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Severus,  Archbishop of Antioch,  from the Letter to Caesaria the Noblewoman</span>.❧ <br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 082-1&lt;/span&gt;">82</span></span> <span class="cap">T</span>hat problem which you have asked is from the Docetists who follow the Manichees. </span><br/> They think that they are propounding something irrefutable and they assert:  “If the Lord</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">2:21</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 82</span></span>After eight days had passed<br/> it was time to circumcise the child; <br/> and he was called Jesus,  the<br/> name given by the angel before<br/> he was conceived in<br/> the womb. </div><div class="column col-right"> submitted to circumcision<br/> according to the law, <br/> just as the gospel<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> says:  “When eight<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> days were fulfilled<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> it was time to<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> circumcise the child; <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and he was called<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Jesus,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 2:21&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> what became<br/> of his foreskin?” </div><div class="column col-full"> For those wretched people think that we are enclosed into confusion,  and they do not<br/> know that to refuse the acknowledgement of what is written because of what is not written<br/> is only characteristic of their own folly and godlessness.
