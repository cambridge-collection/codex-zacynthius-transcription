For the whole account of the dispensation is in ministry and service, <br/> and thus in faith in him it sweeps over all the people and makes them<br/> children of Abraham.  And so,  as the divinely-inspired scripture says that he was, <br/> in truth, circumcised,  who is it who would dare to say that circumcision did not<br/> endure,  which is what those who maintain this fantasy wish to deny,  with<br/> everything else.  And since nothing is written about the part of him which<br/> was circumcised – and I am speaking of his foreskin – for the sake of this the speaker<br/> says that we will not agree that he was truly circumcised.  For thus it is fitting for us</div><div class="column col-left"> to fulfil all<br/> righteousness,  and he<br/> was made like us<br/> in all things without<br/> sin.

And guessing at things which are undisclosed<br/> is excessively dangerous.

For<br/> we too ourselves in the resurrection of our body will be carried away complete. <br/> It will not have disfigurement from wounds or any other sort of suffering,  but will be<br/> healthy and entire.  But it is good to question the impious,  who think that from from such<br/> questions they scare those who believe correctly,  and they avoid what relates to<br/> the true sufferings and that do not admit that the Lord suffered in the flesh.
