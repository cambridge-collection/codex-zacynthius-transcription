For ministry and service is the whole reason for God’s<br/> dispensation.  Thus by faith in him he caught all the nations and made them<br/> children of Abraham.  So,  as the divinely-inspired scripture says that he was<br/> truly circumcised,  who would dare to say that he did not submit to circumcision? <br/> This is what those who maintain this fantasy wish to deny,  along with<br/> other things.  And since nothing is written about the part of him which<br/> was circumcised – I am speaking of his foreskin – for the sake of this will we<br/> not agree that he was truly circumcised?  He said “For thus it is fitting for us</div><div class="column col-left"> to fulfil all<br/> righteousness” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 3:15&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> and he<br/> was made like us<br/> “in all things yet without<br/> sin.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.

It is certainly clearly established in his regard that when<br/> he rose from the dead,  he also kept this uncorrupted,  as it was a part which belonged<br/> to his whole body,  according to the ineffable words which he knew to guard it for this<br/> purpose.  For we too ourselves in the resurrection will receive our own body complete: <br/> it will not have diminution from wounds or any other sort of suffering,  but will be<br/> healthy and perfect.  But it is good to question the impious,  who think that from such<br/> questions they scare those who believe correctly and they reduce them to not<br/> acknowledging that the Lord suffered true sufferings in the flesh.
