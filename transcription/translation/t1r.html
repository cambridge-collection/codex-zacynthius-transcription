These sections emerge as there are teachings in them<br/> unharmonious with church tradition,  which were spoken by the<br/> heretics.  I did not do this of my own accord,  but Ι followed our<br/> most holy father,  Archbishop Cyril of the great and Christ-loving<br/> city of Alexandria,  who says in his Letter to Eulogius: <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> “One ought not to avoid and refuse everything which heretics say. <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> For they grant many things which we also grant.”  I thought that it<br/> was indispensable to add this to the present introduction as a clarification<br/> and explanation for those who encounter it.  For they should know that<br/> those who have interpreted this divinely-inspired scripture have not<br/> only been carried in different ways in their ideas but,  indeed,  have<br/> not divided the very words of the same divine scripture identically, <br/> and have laid out their interpretation accordingly.  For one of them<br/> made their exposition setting out more words and another fewer. <br/> Because of this,  the numbers which are assigned to the chapters<br/> seem to provoke those who read the text to go further forwards. <br/><span class="hang"> <span class="cap">S</span>o one ought to read the first and the second or even the third chapter of the</span><br/> text of the divine scripture,  and the accompanying interpretations in this manner<br/> so that the ideas may be easily comparable for those who encounter them.❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
