But they will be anxious at the fear of loss and,  they say, <br/> it is consistent for them to say that in appearance only and not in truth did the<br/> blood flow.  John,  who became Bishop of Constantinople and herald of the dispensation<br/> of the truth,  has spoken with boldness when he began in the sermon which is<br/> written down ‘About the Cross and about the Robber’:  he did not fear the fear of<br/> these unholy people,  but said that the blood dripped on the earth and purified<br/> all of it.  He has written as follows:  “For what reason is he slaughtered on the height<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> of the scaffold and not under a roof?  So that he might purify the nature of the air: <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> for this reason it is on high and not with a roof lying above,  but with the heaven<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> lying above.

At the moment of the resurrection,  lacking nothing in this respect,  he arose<br/> complete and uncorrupted with his whole body.  However,  he showed the marks<br/> of the nails and the spear,  in which he will also be seen by those who pierced him, <br/> according to the unerring sayings of the divinely-inspired scripture.❧ <br/><span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;This line appears to be blank&lt;/span&gt;">*</span><br/> NB.
