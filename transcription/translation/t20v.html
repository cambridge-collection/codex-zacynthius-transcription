This is a sign that the formation itself<br/> required cleansing from God.  The formation of Christ was holy:  it was not from human<br/> seeds but from divine power.  His birth was also holy,  but it was not<br/> according to what had been made holy.  The clean one was not cleansed.  And just as he was baptised<br/> when he did not need cleansing through water,  but so that he should make the waters holy,  and so that<br/> he should fulfil all righteousness,  in obedience to the prophet,  so in this way for his purification<br/> the offering was made for the one who did not require purification,  doves and pigeons, <br/> a sign of his simple and modest behaviour.  Such things are shadows and models<br/> for humans, but for Christ they are the truth.  For he is the power of true modesty, <br/> and the substance of true simplicity.  ❧<span class="space tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Space of 4 character(s)&lt;/span&gt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From an unattributed source.  ❧</span></div><div class="column col-left"><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 083-2&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">83</span></span></span> <span class="cap">T</span>ell me,  what sort of</span><br/> purification when it was not<br/> the union of woman<br/> and man?

For<br/> the God-bearer does not bear God being subject to the pains of Eve.  For the curse which<br/> was in paradise does not hold the land there,  for the virgin mother did not conceive and give birth<br/> in the same way as other women,  of which cleansing you now read and write.  Luke<br/> speaks riddles to us with the same word purification.  Do not distract me by speaking of the purification<br/> of the defilement of the flesh according to the custom of those who give birth and are born.  For<br/> the offspring of the one who had not experienced marriage was absolutely undefiled,  as the birth was from<br/> the Father without intermediary before eternity.  But it reminds us of the formation of<br/> Adam and Eve from the dust,  which was holy and pure and stronger stronger than all filth and blemish<br/> and all disgrace,  and how it did not underlie it.  The one of those who were disobedient<br/> was subjected to labours and in want of a worse path of life from turning aside,  instead of the stronger sounds,  and a curse instead of a blessing,  and death instead of immortality. </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
