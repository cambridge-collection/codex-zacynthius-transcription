This is a sign that the formation itself required cleansing from<br/> God.  In the case of Christ,  the formation was holy:  it was not from human seeds but from<br/> divine power.  What was born was also holy,  but it was not so by being been made holy;  he<br/> was clean not by being cleansed.  Similarly,  he was baptised when he did not need cleansing<br/> through water,  but so that he should make the waters of baptism holy and so that he<br/> should fulfil all righteousness, <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf. Matthew 3:15&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> in obedience to the prophet.  In this way,  then,  for his<br/> purification an offering was made for the one who did not require purification,  doves and<br/> pigeons,  a sign of his simple and modest behaviour.  Such things are shadows and types<br/> for humans,  but in the case of Christ they are the truth:  for he is the power of true modesty, <br/> and the state of being of true simplicity.❧ <span class="space tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;                                Space of 4 character(s)                                &lt;/span&gt;">                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Cyril of Alexandria, Fragments on Luke (Mai)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=5207&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 5207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From an unattributed source.❧ </span></div><div class="column col-left"><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 083-2&lt;/span&gt;">83</span></span> <span class="cap">T</span>ell me,  what sort of purification</span><br/> was it,  when it was not the<br/> union of woman and man? <br/> When it was not sleep nor<br/> pleasure which came together? <br/> When it was not marriage, </div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">2:22</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;"> 12<br/></span><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 83</span></span>When the time came for their<br/> purification according to the<br/> law of Moses. </div><div class="column col-full"> not copulation?  What sort of purification?  For,  evangelist,  there is no account of a bed,  for<br/> the God-bearer is not struck by the pains of Eve when she bears gods.  The curse which was<br/> in paradise does not hold sway there,  for the virgin mother did not conceive and give birth<br/> in the same way as other women.  The purification of which you now read and write,  Luke<br/> hints to us by using the same word,  purification:  it is not of defiled or transient flesh in<br/> the manner of those who give birth and are born.  Away with you!  For the offspring from the<br/> one who had not experienced marriage was undefiled and absolute,  since his origin was from<br/> the Father without intermediary before eternity.  But it reminds us of the formation of the<br/> earthly Adam and Eve,  which was holy and pure of any filth and blemish,  stronger than any<br/> disgrace,  and how not one of these things was presupposed.  Once they had been disobedient, <br/> it was made subject to labour and,  from their turning aside it was bound to a turn for the worse<br/> instead of the better utterances:  a curse instead of a blessing,  and death instead of immortality. <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;One or two pages are missing, which would have contained Luke 2:22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;33 and its commentary.&lt;/span&gt;">*</span></div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
