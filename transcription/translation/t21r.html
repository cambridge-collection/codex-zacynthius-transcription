For while the appearance<br/> of the Lord is destructive of bodily sufferings,  it stimulates<br/> the specific features of the soul.  As it is when Paul says: “  When I am weak, then<br/> I am powerful. ”  The same person is weak and powerful,  but while he is weak in the flesh, he is<br/> powerful in the Spirit.  Thus too the Lord does not provide some people the instigation for falling, <br/> and others for rising.  For those who fall from the state in which they once were<br/> very clearly fall down.
