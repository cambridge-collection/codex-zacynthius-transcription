Paul also teaches us something of this sort when he talks about him and us: <br/> “For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father.  For this<br/> reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers,  saying,  ‘I will proclaim your name<br/> among my brothers’.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Hebrews 2:11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Since he is completely unashamed to call us brothers because<br/> of his assumption of our likeness,  because he transferred to himself our poverty,  he<br/> is sanctified with us even though he himself sanctifies the whole creation,  so that<br/> he should not appear to be refusing the measure of humanity.  He did not flee from<br/> being born human for the sake of the salvation and the life of all,  and was born<br/> in our likeness in every respect whatever apart from sin alone.❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
