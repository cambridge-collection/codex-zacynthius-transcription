Paul also teaches us something<br/> of this sort when he talks about him and us: “  For the one who makes holy and also those who are made<br/> holy from one person. ”  For this reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers, <br/> saying, “  I will announce your name among my brothers, ”  since he is completely<br/> unashamed to call us brothers because it is this likeness which was the one which came<br/> to us.  Because he adopted our poverty in himself, <br/> he is made holy with us,  even though he himself makes the whole creation holy,  so that<br/> he should not appear to be excusing the measure of humanity,  he who did not flee from being born Human for the sake of the salvation and the life of all,  and was born<br/> in our likeness in all respects so that he was he was without a single sin.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
