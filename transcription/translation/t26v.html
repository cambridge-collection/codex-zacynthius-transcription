Not so much that he was taken away,  but that he</span><br/> spent time and made his dwelling.  For we ourselves are also accustomed in a<br/> fashion to say of everyone who lives in moderation,  ‘This particular person leads<br/> his life well’.  So Jesus made his dwelling in the desert “in the Spirit”:  this means<br/> spiritually.  For he had fasted,  giving absolutely nothing as nourishment for the<br/> needs of the body.  He was not himself in need of fasting,  but he is a type for us: <br/> he set up his own affairs as a template and was made an example of an exceptional<br/> and admirable life among us.  For from where could we know that,  for those on<br/> earth,  loving to spend time in deserted places is beneficial and necessary for<br/> salvation?  For such people go away,  as if it were from waves and storms and the<br/> useless distractions of this present life.

Then you will lay hold of the deserts<br/> with spiritual power;  then you will fast in a holy fashion and mortify<br/> pleasures and you will be stronger than Satan when he tempts you. <br/><span class="centrejust"><span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Severus of Antioch, Against the Testament of Lampetius&lt;/span&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Severus,  Archbishop of Antioch,  from his treatise against the Testament of Lampetios.❧ </span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 123-2&lt;/span&gt;">23</span></span> <span class="cap">J</span>ust as he was baptised for us even though he did not need purification,  being himself the</span><br/> purification and sanctification of the waters,  so he both fasts and is tempted on our behalf. <br/> In the respect that he is truly human,  he attracts the temptation of the devil;  in the respect that<br/> he is God,  he himself is unapproachable by the tempter.
