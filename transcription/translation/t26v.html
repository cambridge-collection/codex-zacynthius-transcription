Not rather that he was carried away,  but that he spent time and made his</span><br/> dwelling.  For somehow we ourselves also have the habit of talking about each living thing in<br/> a likeness: “  Such a one perchance drives himself well. ”  So he made his dwelling<br/> Lin the desert in the Spirit:  this means spiritually.  For he had fasted, <br/> giving absolutely nothing as nourishment for the need of the body.  He was not himself<br/> in need of fasting,  but being a model for us he set up his own affairs as an decree<br/> and was made an image of an exceptional and marvellous life<br/> among us.  For from where could we know the people on the earth,  that loving to spend time in deserted places is beneficial for them and necessary for salvation? <br/> For they go away,  as if it were from the waves and storms and the distractions that there are<br/> in this present life.

Accordingly you too should<br/> first put on the armour of God,  the breastplate of hope, <br/> the helmet of salvation.  You should first clothe yourself in power<br/> from on high,  meaning that you should be revealed as a sharer in the holy Spirit through<br/> the honour of baptism,  and then you should choose to succeed in the life with God<br/> that is desirable and held in honour.  Then you will seize the deserts with<br/> spiritual power;  then you will fast in a holy fashion and turn pleasures to<br/> corpses,  and you will be stronger than the Satan who tempts you. <br/><span class="centrejust"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Severus the Archbishop of Antioch,  from his treatise against the Testament of Lampetios ❧</span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 123-2&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">23</span></span></span> <span class="cap2">J</span>ust as he was baptised for us even though he did not need purification,  being himself purification and</span><br/> the sanctification of the waters,  so he both fasts for us and is tempted.
