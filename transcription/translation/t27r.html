For he does<br/> not consider us worthy<br/> of being spared.  Through<br/> this we owe an exhibit<br/> to these people that<br/> Christ has never<br/> given himself as<br/> a sign for those who<br/> tempt.  For“  a wicked<br/> and adulterous generation<br/> asks for a sign, </div><div class="column col-full"> and a sign shall not be given to it. ”  May the tempter,  Satan,  hear this now<br/> too.  Accordingly,  we have been victorious in Christ,  and the one who once ruled in Adam<br/> has departed in shame,  so that we should have him under our feet.  For when Christ<br/> was victorious,  then he sent to us as well the ability to be victorious. “  See, ” <br/> he says, “  I have given you power to trample on snakes and scorpions and on all the power<br/> of the enemy. ”  Observe how he mischievously wishes through deploying the Scriptures</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
