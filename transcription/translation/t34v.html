He shows this, saying: “  A patch from an old garment cannot be added to<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> a new one, nor can old wineskins support new wine. ”  For the<br/> first covenant has grown old,  and was not without fault.

For all things have become new in him.  They also have<br/> unsound intelligence and are irreconcilable and ill-suited for the service of the new<br/> covenant.  And,  indeed, through one of the holy prophets,  the God of all spoke about them somewhere, <br/> saying that, “  A new heart and a new Spirit will I put in them. ”  The blessed David also writes in a<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> psalm as follows: “  Create in me a new heart,  God,  and renew a righteous<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Spirit in my inner organs. ”  We too have been instructed to cast off<br/> the old Human and to put on the new one which has been renewed according to the<br/> image of its creator.  Paul also offers advice,  saying: “  Do not be conformed<br/> to this age,  but be transformed in the renewing of your<br/> mind,  so that you approve what is the good and pleasing and perfect will<br/> of God. ”  So those who have not yet obtained renewal in the Spirit do not<br/> know how to approve the good and pleasing and perfect will of God.  The heart<br/> of the Jews is accordingly an old wineskin,  and because of this it has not supported the<br/> new wine,  meaning the gospel and salvific pronouncement which gladdens the<br/> Human heart.  But Christ has shown that we are full of such good<br/> things.  ❧<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;At least one page is missing after fol. 34.&lt;/span&gt;">*</span></div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
