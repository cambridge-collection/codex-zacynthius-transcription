And pursuing these things in their deed,  this one has not obtained for<br/> himself what he has rather than for those who are in need.  The one who weeps is not rich,  but<br/> poor in Spirit and an inheritor of the kingdom of the Heavens.  This is the<br/> blessed poverty of the Spirit;  this is the wealth which has also been well mastered, <br/> and like a servant and slave put at the service of good works.  Accordingly, <br/> being wealthy is not forbidden,  but rather being enslaved to the desire for wealth<br/> and being led towards it like a low-born captive slave.  ❧<span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Cyril</span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 171-2&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">71</span></span> ›</span> <span class="cap">I</span>ndeed, it says again in Matthew: “  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst</span><br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> for righteousness,  because they will be satisfied.

For righteousness<br/> shows this.  But since we should give an account of what has just been said, <br/> the intention which follows is also shown forth in these words.  Again we say<br/> that the Saviour called blessed those who loved voluntary poverty,  to accomplish<br/> the apostolic course beyond what is noble and unhindered.  But what is always<br/> necessary for those who are poor in this way and the scarcity and lack of necessities<br/> which accompanies it,  is to find means of nourishment.  For not having gold<br/> or silver in their belts, or two tunics,  is followed in all ways by their ability<br/> to endure hard training,  the burden for these in labour and persecutions. <br/> Accordingly this is very suitable that the one who knows how to limit the feelings of their heart does not allow<br/> it to tend to what comes to pass out of poverty.  For,  he says, those who are now hungry<br/> for the sake of piety towards him will be satisfied,  meaning that they will<br/> luxuriate in the good things which will be given to them,  plainly both intelligible and<br/> spiritual.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
