And pursuing these things by their own deeds,  this man has not<br/> obtained what he has for himself rather than for his needs.  The one who weeps<br/> is not rich,  but poor in spirit and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.  This<br/> is the poverty blessed by the Spirit;  this is the wealth which has also been<br/> well mastered,  and like a servant and slave put at the service of good works. <br/> Accordingly,  being wealthy is not forbidden,  but being enslaved to the desire for<br/> wealth and being led towards it like a low-born captive slave.❧ <span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Cyril of Alexandria, Fragment II.80 on Luke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=5207&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 5207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Cyril</span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 171-2&lt;/span&gt;">71</span> ›</span> <span class="cap">I</span>ndeed,  again in Matthew he says:  “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst</span><br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> for righteousness,  because they will be satisfied.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 5:6&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Here,  in contrast,  he says<br/> simply that “the hungry”  will be blessed<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.

For righteousness shows<br/> this.  But since we ought also to give an account of the meaning in these words, <br/> following the explanation of what was spoken before,  we say again that the<br/> Saviour called blessed those who love voluntary poverty,  to accomplish the<br/> apostolic course beyond what is fine and unhindered.  But it is assuredly the<br/> case for those who practise this sort of poverty that both scarcity of necessities<br/> and finding barely enough nourishment accompanies it.  For assuredly it follows<br/> having neither gold or silver in their belts,  or two tunics,  that they must endure the<br/> greatest hardship.  This is a burden for those in toil and persecutions,  and for this<br/> reason and very appropriately,  the one who knows the heart does not permit us to<br/> be dispirited at what results from poverty.  For,  he says,  those who are now hungry<br/> for the sake of piety towards him will be satisfied,  meaning that they will luxuriate<br/> in the good things which will be given to them,  plainly both the intelligible and<br/> the spiritual.❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
