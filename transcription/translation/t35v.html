But we say that weeping</span><br/> is not simply those who shed a teardrop from the eyes,  for this is common and accompanies<br/> all,  believers and unbelievers,  if one of the customary reasons to grieve should come to<br/> pass.  Rather it is those who shun a life of hilarity and dissolution among carnal<br/> pleasures.  For we say that,  while some people live in enjoyment and laughter, <br/> others,  who refuse luxury and unbridled carnality and are all but weeping<br/> because they hate what is worldly,  the Saviour says are blessed.  Therefore,  having<br/> commanded us to practise poverty,  he crowns with honours the things which follow<br/> poverty,  which are the lack of necessities for nourishment and being downcast through<br/> affliction.  For it is written that “The afflictions of the righteous are many,  and the Lord<br/> will save them from them all.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Psalm 33:20 LXX&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>❧ <span class="space tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;                                Space of 10 character(s)                                &lt;/span&gt;">                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Cyril of Alexandria, Homily 28 on Luke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=5207&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 5207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From the same.❧ </span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 173-1&lt;/span&gt;">73</span></span> <span class="cap">A</span>lready he announces the persecution,  before the apostles were sent out.

Accordingly,  when the occasion arises on which<br/> these things would come to pass at the hands of certain people,  in order that they do not<br/> fall into senseless apathy,  he announces in advance for their benefit that even the<br/> approach of harsh things will be rewarding and advantageous for them.  For,  he says,  they<br/> will abuse you as misled and separate you as deceivers from them,  meaning from<br/> friendship and communion with them.  But,  he says,  let no account be taken of such<br/> things among you.  For what injustice will the uncontrolled tongue of such people do to the<br/> mind which is well-established?
