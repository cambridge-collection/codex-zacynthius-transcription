And Mark places<br/> this next,  expounding more clearly the thought of the Saviour and writing as follows: <br/>“  How difficult it is for those who trust in possessions to enter into the<br/> kingdom of God. ”  It is not about being a lord of possessions, but trusting<br/> in goods which will shut off the kingdom of the Heavens.  Who is the person<br/> who trusts in possessions?  The one who does not hear the voice of the Lord saying, “  Do not<br/> lay up for yourselves treasure on the earth, where moth and decay do away with<br/> it,  and where thieves break in and steal.  But lay up for yourselves</div><div class="column col-left"> treasures in<br/> heaven, where<br/> neither moth nor<br/> decay do away<br/> with it,  and<br/> where thieves<br/> do not break in<br/> in or steal.
