For the one who is unmotivated is not well motivated for<br/> what is easy.  But the one who is eager is also able to face annoyances.  He says, <br/>“  Take my yoke and know that my burden is light. ”  For if you<br/> carry it completely,  what seems to you to be heavy will be found<br/> most light when it is experienced.  ❧<br/><span class="centrejust"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Cyril</span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 175-2&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">75</span></span></span> <span class="cap">T</span>he blessed Paul speaks truly that“  Ifsomeone is in Christ,  it is a new creation. ”  For everything</span><br/> that has happened in him and through him is new,  both the covenant and the law and<br/> the constitution.  But observe how extremely proper such a constitution and life<br/> is for the holy teachers.  They were going to announce the message of salvation<br/> to people throughout the earth,  and next they were told to expect that those who<br/> persecuted them and plotted in various ways would not be easy to number. <br/> But if it happens that the disciples were vexed by such grievances,  whether they wished to</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">6:27</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 75</span></span>But I say to you that listen, <br/> Love your enemies, </div><div class="column col-right"> ward off those<br/> hurt them,  they<br/> would keep quiet<br/> and outrun them, </div><div class="column col-full"> as they had not yet set the divine proclamation before them,  or called them to<br/> knowledge of the truth.  Accordingly,  it was necessary through patient endurance of such problems<br/> to build up the mind of the holy teachers,  so that they should bear nobly everything that<br/> happens to them,  even if some scorn them and plot against them in an unholy fashion.  But he had<br/> experienced this himself,  even before the others,  as a model for us.  For even as he still<br/> hung on the costly cross,  even though the multitude of the Jews laughed<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> at him,  he made intercession to the God and Father for them,  saying, “  Forgive<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> them because they do not know what they are doing. ”  Yes,  indeed, the blessed Stephen as well,  even though<br/> he was being pelted with stones bent his knees and prayed,  saying, “  Lord,  do not hold this<br/> sin against them. ”  And the blessed Paul: “  When we are cursed, we bless; <br/> when we are reviled,  we offer comfort. ”  Accordingly, while such such an exhortation<br/> was necessary for the holy apostles,  it is also most useful for us in order to direct<br/> our way of life in a correct and admirable manner.  For it is full of all wisdom; <br/> preconceptions which are not good and the hard-to-overcome tyranny of the sufferings which are within us<br/> will accomplish in our thoughts that which is hard to do successfully.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
