But observe how extremely proper such a practice and life<br/> is for the holy teachers.  They were going to announce the message of salvation<br/> to people throughout the earth,  and from this it was that they should expect that those who<br/> persecuted them would not be easy to number and they would plot in many different ways. <br/> But if it had resulted that the disciples were vexed by such annoyances and then wished for</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">6:27</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 75</span></span>But I say to you that listen, <br/> Love your enemies, </div><div class="column col-right"> revenge on those<br/> who annoyed them,  they<br/> would have kept quiet<br/> and passed them by, </div><div class="column col-full"> no longer setting the divine proclamation before them or calling them to<br/> knowledge of the truth.  Accordingly,  it was necessary to build up the mind of the holy teachers<br/> through such a solemn sense of endurance that they should bear nobly everything that<br/> happened to them,  even if some scorn them and plot against them in an unholy fashion.  But he had<br/> accomplished this himself,  even before the others,  as a paradigm for us.  For while he was still<br/> hanging on the precious cross,  even though the multitude of the Jews laughed<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> at him,  he made intercession to God the Father for them,  saying,  “Forgive<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> them because they do not know what they do.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 23:34&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Yes,  indeed,  the blessed Stephen too,  even though<br/> he was being pelted with stones bent his knees and prayed,  saying,  “Lord,  do not hold this<br/> sin against them.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Acts 7:60&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And the blessed Paul:  “When we are abused,  we bless; <br/> when we are reviled,  we offer encouragement.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 4:12&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Therefore while such an exhortation<br/> was necessary for the holy apostles,  it is also most useful for us in order that we should<br/> lead our life in a correct and admirable manner.  For it is full of all love of wisdom. <br/> But preconceptions which are not good and the insuperable tyranny of the passions which are<br/> within us render it hard for our minds to accomplish.❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
