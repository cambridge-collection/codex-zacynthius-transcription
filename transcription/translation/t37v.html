But the same blessed Paul said again. <br/> “Once faith has come,  we are no longer under an instructor.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Galatians 3:25&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For we are no longer children in our<br/> minds,  but rather we have grown “to maturity,  to the measure of the full stature<br/> of Christ.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Ephesians 4:13&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Accordingly,  we have no need of milk,  but rather of more solid<br/> food<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf. Hebrews 5:12&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>.  Christ grants this to us,  making clear the way of righteousness beyond<br/> the law.  For he himself said to the holy apostles,  “Truly I say to you,  unless your<br/> righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees,  you will not enter into the<br/> kingdom of heaven.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 5:20&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> I say,  then,  that it is necessary to explain what this<br/> “exceeding in righteousness”  is which is in accordance with the gospel and message<br/> of salvation.  The law which was prophesied through Moses to older generations used to<br/> command a like-for-like approach.  While it prohibited wrongdoing,  it was not rather the case<br/> at all that those who had already been wronged should endure it patiently,  as the law of the<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> gospel wishes.  For it says:  “You shall not murder,  you shall not steal,  you shall not swear falsely” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Exodus 20:15&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>; </div><div class="column col-left"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> further,  in addition<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> to these,  “an eye<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> for an eye,  a<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> hand for a hand, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> a foot for a foot, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> a wound for a<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> wound,  a bruise</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;"> 46</span></span><span class="pageleft"><span class="app"><span class="original hoverover tooltip-corr" data-tooltip-content="#rdg-1000"> ⸆ </span><div class="tooltip_templates"><span id="rdg-1000"><span lang="en" class="tooltip-en">orig: </span><span lang="en" class="tooltip-en">[omitted]</span><br/><span lang="en" class="tooltip-en">corrector: </span><span lang="el" class="tooltip-el">

For it is written that “the beginning of the good way is doing what is just,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Proverbs 16:7 LXX&lt;/span&gt;">*</span><br/> but in the end all perfection is in Christ and from his decrees.  For he says,  “If anyone<br/> strikes you on the cheek,  offer the other also” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 6:29&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> In such matters,  the way of obtaining<br/> patient endurance is indicated to us.  In addition,  he also wishes us to despise so that<br/> even if someone has only a cloak,  they should not think it possessions an unbearable<br/> happening to remove with it their tunic as well.  This virtue belongs to a soul which<br/> is completely turned away from the passion of desiring riches.  For,  he says,  “Do not ask back<br/> from the person who takes your goods,  but give to everyone who begs from you,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.
