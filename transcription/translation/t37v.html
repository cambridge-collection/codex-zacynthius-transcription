For the</span><br/> law has tutored us to the mystery of him.  But the same blessed Paul says again: <br/>“  Once faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. ”  For we are not still children in our<br/> minds, but rather we have grown into a complete man,  into the measure of the age of the<br/> fullness of Christ.  Accordingly,  there is no need of milk,  but rather of solid<br/> food.  Christ grants this to us,  making clear the way of righteousness beyond<br/> the law.  For he himself says to the holy apostles, “  Truly I say to you,  unless your<br/> righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees,  you will not<br/> enter into the Kingdom of the Heavens. ”  Whether there is something in righteousness which<br/> exceeds this,  I say that it is necessary that the gospel and message of salvation<br/> tells fully.  The law which was prophesied through Moses to the ancients<br/> ordered that it should be approached through equal deeds,  and it prohibited evil-doing<br/> and not,  rather,  that those who had previously been wronged should endure evil.  The law of the<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> gospel wishes this,  for it says: “  You shall not murder,  you shall not steal,  you shall not swear falsely. ” </div><div class="column col-left"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Further,  in addition<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> to these,  an eye<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> for an eye, a<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> hand for a hand,<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> a foot for a foot, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> a wound for a<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> wound,  a bruise</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;">46</span></span><span class="app"><span class="original hoverover tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#rdg-1"> ⸆ </span><div class="tooltip_templates"><span id="rdg-1"><span lang="en" class="tooltip-en">orig: </span><span lang="el" class="tooltip-el">

This was from what commanded not to act unjustly to others, <br/> especially those who had previously been wronged,  so that they should not extend their anger against those who had wronged them<br/> beyond what is equal.  But the power of the constitution according to the law was not in all things pleasing<br/> to God,  but it had become for the ancients,  in its position as a tutor who is accustomed<br/> based on a shortcut,  commensurate with righteousness.  And it naturally promotes<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> having good perfectly.  For it is written that the beginning of the good way is doing what is just. <br/> As for the rest,  all perfection is in Christ and from his pronouncements.  For he says, <br/>“  To the one who strikes you on the cheek,  offer the other as well. ”  He shows us the way of<br/> patiently enduring evil so that it ceases in such matters.  But in this matter he also wishes<br/> to be a despiser of goods, so that if someone only has a cloak,  they should not think it<br/> unendurable to remove it and also their tunic.  This is the virtue of the<br/> soul,  to be completely turned away from the emotion of loving riches.  For, he says, <br/>“  Do not demand back from the person who takes something of yours,  but give to all who demand from you” ,  which is a<br/> proof of love and embracing of poverty.  The one who loves mercy should be like this</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
