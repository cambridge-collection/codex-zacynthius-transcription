For indeed it is necessary for certain people to examine themselves and order their lives<br/> according to God,  they do not do this but they meddle with other people’s business. <br/> If they see anyone unwell,  they approach them as a way of forgetting their own<br/> weaknesses.  They make money the pretext for censoriousness,  and the starting-point<br/> for slander.  For they condemn them,  not knowing that they are just as<br/> sick as those who suffer at their hands.  They pass sentence on themselves. <br/> The most wise Paul also writes somewhere in this way: “  For in the manner that you judge someone</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text">is merciful. <br/><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">6:37</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 79</span></span><span class="cap">D</span>o not judge,  and you will not be</span><br/> judged;  do not condemn, <br/> and you will not be condemned. <br/> Forgive and you will be forgiven; <br/><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">6:38</span>give and you will be given to you. <br/> A good measure,  pressed down, <br/> running over,  will be<br/> put into your lap; </div><div class="column col-right"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> else,  you pass sentence<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> on yourself.  For you, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> the judge,  do the same<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> things.  Indeed, you<br/> should rather pity those<br/> who are weak,  as they<br/> are subject to the onsets<br/> of their sufferings and<br/> held captive by the<br/> inescapable snares of</div><div class="column col-full"> sin.  And you should pray for such people and encourage then and<br/> rouse them to sobriety and attempt not to fall foul of the same charges. “  For the one<br/> who judges his brother, ”  as the disciple of the Lord says, “  talks down the law, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and judges the law.  There is one lawgiver and judge. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;James 4:11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For the judge of<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> sinful nature should be the one from above.  Since you are not such a person, why do<br/> you judge your neighbour?  The one who errs should confess to the judge.  If you dare to condemn, <br/> even though you do not have the authority for this,  you will rather be condemned<br/> yourself as someone who was not permitted by the law to judge others.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
