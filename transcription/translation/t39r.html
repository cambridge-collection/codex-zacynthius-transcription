For while it is necessary for people to examine themselves and order their lives<br/> according to God,  when they do not do this they meddle instead with other people’s business. <br/> If they see anyone unwell,  just as if they reach forgetfulness of their own<br/> weaknesses,  they make the matter the pretext for finding fault and a starting-point<br/> for slander.  For they condemn them:  not knowing that they are equally<br/> sick as those who suffer at their hands,  they pass sentence on themselves. <br/> Thus the most wise Paul also writes somewhere,  “For in passing judgement on another</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text">is merciful. <br/><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">6:37</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 79</span></span><span class="cap">D</span>o not judge,  and you will not be</span><br/> judged;  do not condemn, <br/> and you will not be condemned. <br/> Forgive and you will be forgiven; <br/><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">6:38</span>give and you will be given to<br/> you.

We ought to pray for such people and encourage them and<br/> rouse them to sobriety and endeavour not to fall into the same faults.  “For the one<br/> who judges his brother,”  as the disciple of the Lord says,  “speaks against the law, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and judges the law.  There is one lawgiver and judge.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;James 4:11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For the judge of sinful<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> nature should be above it.  As you are not such a person,  why do you judge your neighbour? <br/> The sinner will defend themselves before the judge.  But if you dare to condemn, <br/> even though you do not have the authority for this,  you will rather be condemned<br/> yourself,  as the law does not allow judging others.❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
