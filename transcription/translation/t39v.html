For if we receive a measure which is</span><br/> fine and pressed down and overflowing,  how will it be measured back to us in<br/> the measure which we measure out?  It seems rather that there is an equality between these, <br/> and there is not some excess in the recompense which will be given to us.  What, then,  are we to<br/> say?  The most wise Paul will resolve matteers for us and supply a solution<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> to these questions.  For he says that“  The one who sows sparingly” , <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> instead of commensurately and with his hand clenched, “  will also reap<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> sparingly.

If someone does not have anything, he has not erred in not doing this.  For it is acceptable based on<br/> what one may have,  not based on what one does not have.  This is also what the law which came through the<br/> all-wise Moses prescribes.  For each person takes as a sacrifice to God what they have at hand and</div><div class="column col-left"> within their strength, <br/> under the law.

They were craftsmen working<br/> towards every good work and to implant the accurate and saving word which<br/> led to truth in those who were instructed.  They had already seen this before, <br/> and had their intelligence richly illuminated by the divine light, <br/> so that they should not be blind guides of the blind.  And if it were to happen that<br/> some of them did advance to this,  so that they became a rival (εισαμιλλον)  to those training to obtain<br/> virtue, they will be set up as a measure of the teachers and they will be imitators<br/> of them.  Again, Paul is trustworthy when he says, “  Become imitators of me, <br/> just as I am of Christ” ,  of the teacher who does not yet judge.  Why do you yourself<br/> judge?  For he did not come to judge the world but to pity it.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
