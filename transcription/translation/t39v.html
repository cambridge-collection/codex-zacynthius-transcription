The most wise Paul will free us from difficulties and supply a solution<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> to these questions.

Even if it came to pass that<br/> some people advanced to such a point that they obtained virtue in rivalry with their instructors, <br/> they will be made to stop at the level of their teachers and be imitators<br/> of them.
