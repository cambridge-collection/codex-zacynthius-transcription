Through this,  he has conferred upon them<br/> the divine dignity,  I mean,  the ability to forgive sins to whomever they wish,  but also to retain<br/> those of others.  Before the Resurrection of Christ and his Ascension into heaven,  the spirit of<br/> adoption was not among human beings:  the all-wise evangelist John makes this plain when he says, <br/> “For as yet there was no Spirit,  because Jesus was not yet glorified,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;John 7:39&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> meaning the glorious<br/> resurrection from the dead and the entrance into heaven.
