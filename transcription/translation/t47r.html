For before the resurrection of Christ and his ascension into Heaven, <br/> the Spirit of adoption was not among Humans.  The all-wise evangelist John makes this plain<br/> when he says, “  For there was not yet a Spirit because Jesus was not yet glorified” ,  meaning the glorious<br/> resurrection from the dead and the entrance into the Heavens.
