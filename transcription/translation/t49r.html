You might inquire whether</span><br/> the woman who anointed the Lord with myrrh was a single person or two,  for the four evangelists<br/> have written that he was anointed with myrrh by a woman.  I have considered this myself<br/> and made a careful study of the narrative.  Having looked intently at the<br/> accuracy of the words of the gospels, I reckon there are three women<br/> and one man,  from the quality of the characters and from the manner of the deed<br/> itself and from the difference of the occasions.  For John says this about Mary, <br/> the sister of Lazarus and Martha,  who is exceedingly praised and pious, <br/> and is reckoned among the disciples for Jesus,  giving his account as<br/> follows: “  And so Jesus,  six days before the Passover,  came to Bethany, where there was<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Lazarus,  whom Jesus raised from the dead.

Matthew introduces a long discourse regarding how Jesus would be on<br/> the saving cross,  and how he wished to proceed,  which he spoke to the disciples</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
