One might inquire whether</span><br/> it was one woman or two who anointed the Lord with myrrh,  for the four evangelists have<br/> written that he was anointed with myrrh by a woman.  Accordingly,  I have considered this<br/> myself and made a careful study of the narrative.  Having looked intently at the<br/> accuracy of the gospel writings,  I reckon there are three women and<br/> one man,  from the quality of the characters and from the manner of the deed<br/> itself and from the difference of the occasions.  For John says this about Mary, <br/> the sister of Lazarus and Martha,  who is exceedingly praised and pious, <br/> and is reckoned among the disciples of Jesus,  giving his account as<br/> follows:  “Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany,  the home of<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Lazarus,  whom he had raised from the dead.
