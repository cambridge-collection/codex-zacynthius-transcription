This was to show paradoxically that the sound of God is seen by those to whom it is seen.  In<br/> the gospel,  however,  the sound is not seen but the greater word of the sound.  For this reason,  it was just as<br/> those who became eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning handed down to us.  For if seeing<br/> the Lord in bodily form made someone a eyewitness of this,  Pilate was also an eyewitness of<br/> the word when he condemned him,  and Judas his betrayer,  and everyone who shouted“  Crucify, <br/> crucify him. ”  So the knowledge of the word was perceived there,  where the Saviour said: “  The one who has seen<br/> me has seen the Father who sent me. ”  And,  having forgotten what a fine lesson this is,  Luke<br/> teaches us next that contemplation is the goal of some of what is seen,  and that</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">1:2</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 5</span></span>were handed on to us<br/> by those from the beginning were eyewitnesses<br/> and servants of<br/><span class="centerjust"> the word, </div><div class="column col-right"> activity is the goal of<br/> other things that are seen.

Yet the phrase“  becoming servants of the word”  can also be taken differently.  They are of the<br/> word of instruction which the Saviour passed on to them,  or also the word of God himself,  whom the<br/> present disciples have also served.  ❧<br/><span class="centrejust"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Severus, Archbishop of Antioch.

Tell me,  do you also see?  Unless it was subjected, how then without<br/> sin did he unite flesh to himself,  according to the hypostasis which is like in nature to us?  It has a soul<br/> which is both rational and intellectual,  from the Holy Spirit and from the holy God-bearer and always-virgin<br/> Mary.  It sees completely the reality which is both touchable and rigid.  Likewise Paul too,<br/> when he says“  He was revealed in flesh because of this very thing and he was seen by angels. ”  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
