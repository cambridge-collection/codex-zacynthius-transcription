But while it was seed,  as it was not<br/> their own:  instead,  they have what they received.  Christ,  however,  has his own seed,  from<br/> his own nature,  as he brings forth teaching.

For the one who plants takes from one place and transfers to another.  The one who<br/> sows does not transplant,  but he takes from his own storehouses and scatters, <br/> sowing with a generous hand.  Paul said,  “Since you desire proof that Christ<br/> is speaking in me.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;2 Corinthians 13:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> But the Saviour says:  “Do not call anyone teacher on earth.
