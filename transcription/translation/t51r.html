For he gave to us the ability alone for<br/> parables and dark speech,  the words of the wise and riddles.  For they<br/> are images,  like the parables,  of deeds which are not seen but are rather understood<br/> and spiritual in nature.

And the world did not know him.  The sower went out to sow<br/> his personal seed.  Why“  personal” ?  For it does not borrow the word.  The word of God<br/> exists in nature:  there is not a personal seed of Paul,  or of John,  or of<br/> any other of the apostles or prophets,  but what the seed was it was not<br/> personal to them,  but they have what they received.  Yet Christ has a personal seed,  from<br/> his own nature,  which he brings forth in his teaching.  For if Paul says: “  I planted, <br/> Apollos watered, ”  he grants the sowing to the Saviour,  but the planting to<br/> himself.  For the one who plants takes it from one place and transfers it to another.  The one who<br/> sows does not plant,  but he takes from his personal storehouses and scatters, <br/> sowing with a plentiful hand.
