Such<br/> people have piety towards God which is light and without roots.  They go into the<br/> churches,  they feel pleasure at the multitude of those who are assembled and they gladly<br/> accept instruction in the mysteries,  but in an undiscriminating way and from shallow<br/> wishes.  Once they have gone out of the churches,  they are straightaway carried off<br/> from the holy teachings to forgetfulness.  While Christian affairs are carried on<br/> a fair wind and there is no trial disturbing them,  even at such a time these people<br/> scarcely keep safe the faith within them.  But when persecution is raging, <br/> they have a heart which avoids conflict and a mind which runs away.  To them the prophet</div><div class="column col-left"> Jeremiah says: <br/> “Take up weapons<br/> and shields,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 26:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> especially<br/> as the God who<br/> saves has an<br/> unconquerable<br/> hand.  As the<br/> all-wise Paul says, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> “God is faithful, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and he will not let</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">8:13</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 19</span></span><span class="cap">T</span>he ones on the rock are</span><br/> those who,  when they hear<br/> the word,  receive it with joy. <br/> but these have no root;  they<br/> only believe for a while<br/> and in a time of testing fall away. </div><div class="column col-full"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> you be tested beyond your strength,  but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that<br/> you may be able to endure it.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Yet even if it might somehow happen that we suffer in the cause of<br/> championing piety in Christ,  then we would be completely and thoroughly worthy of envy.  Indeed, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> the Saviour declared to the holy apostles,  “Do not fear those who kill<br/> the body,  but cannot kill the soul;  rather fear the one<br/> who can destroy both body and soul in hell.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 10:28&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> He did<br/> not only teach us these things with words,  but also with deeds.  For he laid aside for<br/> us his own soul,  and he won for himself all that is under the heaven with his own<br/> blood.  Accordingly,  we do not belong to ourselves but rather to the one who bought us and<br/> ransomed us,  and we owe to him our life.  For,  as the marvellous<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Paul says,  “For this reason Christ died and lived again,  so that he might be Lord<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> of both the dead and the living” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Romans 14:9&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>.❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
