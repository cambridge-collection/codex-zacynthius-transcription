These<br/> people have a piety towards God which is light and without roots.  They go into the<br/> churches,  they join in with the multitude of those who are assembled and they gladly<br/> accept initiation into the mysteries,  but in an undiscriminating way and from shallow<br/> desires.  Once they have gone out of the churches,  straightaway they are carried off to<br/> forgetfulness of the holy teachings.  While Christian matters are borne with<br/> a fair wind,  and there is no persecution oppressing them,  they retain<br/> such scarce faith as they have within them.  But when oppression is raging, <br/> their heart prefers conflict avoidance and their mind is fugitive.
