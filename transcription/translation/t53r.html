Just as Jeremiah says,  it becomes<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> “A handful which does not have strength to make wheat-meal.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Hosea 8:7&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> “Change,  then,  the changes<br/> for yourselves,”  says another prophet,  “and do not sow among thorns.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 4:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Therefore, <br/> so that the divine seed shall flourish within us,  let us cast out worldly<br/> worries from our minds.  But the rich and fertile soil,  which produces fruit<br/> one-hundredfold with regard to such things,  might very justly be considered<br/> what was spoken from God by one of the holy prophets:  “And all nations<br/> will call you blessed,  because you will be a desired land.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Malachi 3:12&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For whenever</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">8:14</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 20</span></span><span class="cap">A</span>s for those that fell among the</span><br/> thorns,  these are the ones who<br/> hear,  but as they go on their way, <br/> they are choked by the cares and<br/> riches and pleasures of life, <br/> and their fruit does not mature. </div><div class="column col-right"> the divine word is brought<br/> down at some point into a<br/> mind which is pure of the<br/> customary annnoyances, <br/> then it fixes its root<br/> deeply and like an ear<br/> of corn shoots up and<br/> produces fine fruit. <br/> But I think that fact<br/> is also beneficial to say</div><div class="column col-full"> to those who have chosen to learn.  For Matthew,  when he is recounting<br/> this very same chapter to us,  said that the good soil produces fruit<br/> in three different ways.  For he says that one brought forth one hundred,  one<br/> sixty,  and one thirty<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf. Matthew 13:8&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>.  Observe,  then,  how Christ said that there were three types<br/> of failure,  and these are likewise equal in number to the successes.  For<br/> those of the seeds which fall on the path are snatched up by birds; <br/> those in the stony ground only blossom and are withered not a long<br/> time after;  those in the thorns are choked to death.  But the desirable land<br/> brings forth fruit in three different ways,  as I have said:  100,  and 60,  and 30. <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> As the all-wise Paul writes,  “Each has a particular gift from God,  one having<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> one kind and another a different kind.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 7:7&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For we do not find that the successes<br/> which happen for the saints are always and everywhere in equal measure.  It is<br/> simply necessary to be eager for what is better and superior to the more earthly<br/><span class="centrejust"> things.❧ </span></div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
