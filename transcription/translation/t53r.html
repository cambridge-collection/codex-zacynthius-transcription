Just as Jeremiah says,  it becomes<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span>“  A handful which does not have strength to make wheat-meal” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Hosea 8:7&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>. “  Change,  then,  the changes<br/> for yourselves, ”  says another prophet, “  and do not sow among thorns. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 4:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Accordingly, <br/> so that the divine seed may flourish within us,  let us cast off the worldly<br/> worries of their notions.  But the rich and fertile soil,  which produces fruit<br/> one-hundredfold with regard to such things,  might very justly be considered<br/> what was spoken by one of the holy prophets from God: “  And all nations<br/> will bless you,  because you will be a desired land. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Malachi 3:12&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For whenever</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">8:14</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 20</span></span><span class="cap">A</span>s for those that fell among the thorns, </span><br/> theses are the ones who<br/> hear,  but as they go on their way, <br/> they are choked by the<br/> cares and riches and pleasures<br/> of life,  and their fruit does not mature. </div><div class="column col-right"> the divine word is once<br/> brought down into a pure<br/> mind of those who usually<br/> promote activity,  then they<br/> give out a root into the deep<br/> and,  in the manner of an ear<br/> of corn,  it leaps out and<br/> produces fine fruit. <br/> But that,  I think<br/> is useful to say</div><div class="column col-full"> to those who are chosen.  For Matthew,  when he is recounting this very<br/> same chapter to us,  says that the good soil produces fruit<br/> in three different ways.  For he says that one makes one hundred,  one<br/> sixty and one thirty.  See,  then,  how Christ says that there are three types<br/> of damage,  and that they are similarly equal in number to the benefits.  For<br/> those of the seeds which fall on the path are snatched up by birds. <br/> Those in the stony ground only blossom,  not for a long time, <br/> and they are dried out.  Those in the thorns are choked out.  But the desired land<br/> brings forth fruit,  in three different ways as I have said:  100 and 60 and 30. <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> As the all-wise Paul writes, “  Each of us has our personal gift<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> from God,  one in one way and another in another way. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 7:7&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For we do not find that the<br/> benefits which happens to the saints are always and everywhere in equal measure.  It is<br/> simply necessary to be eager for what is greater and underlies the more earthly<br/> things.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
