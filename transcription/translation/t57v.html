It happened,  accordingly,  that this was what<br/> the woman did,  which is why she is sought by the Lord and he calls her into his sight: <br/> the disciples did not know what is being sought,  but thought that the Lord was speaking about a<br/> single touch,  of the same type as all other people touched.  For this reason,  the Lord explains<br/> and says,  “Someone touched me,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 8:46&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> just as he also said “Let anyone with ears to hear listen” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 8:8&lt;/span&gt;">*</span><br/> even though everyone has this sort of bodily hearing and all listen as far as the plain<br/> hearing of the words.  But it was neither possible to hear what was not intelligible, <br/> nor to touch what was not believable.  So why does he call her into his sight and lift his holy<br/> eyes to inspect the woman?  Because she is worthy of the Lord’s sight.  She is also worthy of<br/> demonstration to those who are present,  because she would be an example to all of faith<br/> and an encouragement to faith through the praise which would rightly be given to her.❧ </div><div class="column col-left"><span class="centrejust"><span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Cyril of Alexandria, Homily 45 on Luke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=5207&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 5207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Cyril</span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 241-2a&lt;/span&gt;">41</span></span> <span class="cap">S</span>o did the Lord in</span><br/> desire for fame not allow<br/> the display of divine</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">8:45</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 41</span></span><span class="cap">T</span>hen Jesus asked,  ‘Who touched me?’ </div><div class="column col-full"> activity,  namely the miracle which happened to the woman,  to go unnoticed?
