For to those who</span><br/> wish to accomplish a life as pure and undefiled as is possible for humans,  Christ<br/> makes them bright with gifts from himself:  he grants a rich recompense to them<br/> for what they have led in a holy fashion,  and he establishes them as<br/> sharers of his personal glory.  Take the holy apostles as a clear and effective<br/> demonstration of the matter:  see how they have become most pre-eminent and<br/> crowned with glory beyond what is human,  when Christ gives this too to them<br/> after the other gifts.  For,  it says,  “he has given them power and authority over<br/> all demons and to cure diseases.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 9:1&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> But see again how the incarnate</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:1</span><span class="pageright"><span class="tooltip-struc vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;"> +64</span></span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;"> 64</span><br/><span class="tooltip-struc chapternumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Chapter number&lt;/span&gt;">27</span></span><span class="pageleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 49</span></span><span class="cap">T</span>hen Jesus called the</span><br/> twelve apostles together and<br/> gave them power and<br/> authority over all demons<br/> and to cure diseases, </div><div class="column col-right"> Word of God<br/> exceeds the measure<br/> of humanity and is<br/> prominent in the<br/> dignities of divinity. <br/> For it is beyond<br/> the limits of<br/> humanity and</div><div class="column col-full"> of God alone to grant authority over unclean spirits to those he wishes, <br/> and also the ability to free from sicknesses those who are in their grip. <br/> For both the superiority and the glory of the highest nature subsists by<br/> nature in no being except him and him alone.  Accordingly,  the grace bestowed<br/> on the holy apostles is worthy of wonder,  but beyond all praise and<br/> wonder is the generosity of the bestower,  for he grants,  as I have said,  his own<br/> glory.
