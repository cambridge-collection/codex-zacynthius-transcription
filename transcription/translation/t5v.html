Well,  I say to them that unless this was the case,  it<br/> would not have said, “  Pursue what is right righteously”  whenever we might do the commandments,  so that<br/> there should not be in our conscience the filth of vanity or human obsequiousness or of another thing<br/> of this nature as we do the commandments blamelessly.  ❧<br/><span class="indent"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From an unattributed source</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 014-1&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">14</span></span> <span class="cap">T</span>he Mother was barren and an old woman;  the Father was also an old man</span></div><div class="column col-left"> and while through the law<br/> of righteousness they did<br/> not escape the<br/> deprivation of childlessness, <br/> even though the law<br/> holds it out as a curse<br/> for those who are childless, <br/> yet through Christ<br/> the barren woman becomes a childbearer<br/> and the old woman a Mother. <br/> And she bore over<br/><span class="gap tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;                                Gap of 10-12 lines(s)                                &lt;/span&gt;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span><br/> to her husband.

But because he<br/> was creator of nature,  he created afresh for himself the vessel in which he came to dwell and his<br/> means of entry.
