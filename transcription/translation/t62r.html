He looks into Heaven,  as if asking<br/> for a blessing from above,  and he performs this too deliberately because of us.  For he himself is<br/> the one who fills all;  the blessing is from above and from the Father.  But so that we might<br/> learn that when we begin a meal and are about to break break,  we ought to give thanks<br/> to God,  just as we put it on our upturned hands to call down a blessing on it<br/> from above.

How,  then, <br/> did the miracle turn<br/> out?  A multitude of<br/> people was satisfied, <br/> and not a small one, <br/> for it extended to five<br/> thousand without<br/> women and children. <br/> For this is what<br/> another of the holy<br/> evangelists added of<br/> his own to these<br/> words.  And the<br/> unexpected was not<br/> up to here,  but also<br/> they collected twelve</div><div class="column col-full"> baskets of scraps.  The fulfilment is clear from this,  that the matter of hospitality<br/> has a rich recompense from God.  But it is also possible to see<br/> older wonders which accord with the new ones,  and are the results of the one<br/> and the same power.  Manna rained in the desert for those from Israel: <br/>“  He gave them bread of Heaven. ”  A Human ate bread of angels,  according to what is sung in<br/> the psalms.  But see,  again in the desert he generously arranged food for<br/> those in need,  such as if he brought it down from Heaven.  For multiplying<br/> a little is also like that which came from nothing:  that he thus fed such a great crowd<br/> would not be dissimilar to the first sign.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
