He looks up to heaven,  as<br/> if asking for a blessing from above,  and he performs this as well purposefully for us.  For he himself<br/> is the one who fills all,  the blessing from above and from the Father.  But so that we might<br/> learn that when we begin a meal and are about to break bread we ought to offer it<br/> to God,  as if putting it on upturned hands to call down a blessing on it from above, <br/> he has purposefully become the beginning and the type and the way of the matter</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> <span class="cap">A</span>nd he said to his disciples, </span><br/> ‘Make them sit down in groups<br/> of about fifty each.’ <br/><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:15</span>They did so and made<br/> all of them sit down. <br/><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:16</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 52</span></span><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> <span class="cap">A</span>nd taking the five loaves</span><br/> and the two fish,  he looked up<br/> to heaven,  and blessed<br/> and broke them, </div><div class="column col-right"> for us.  How,  then,  did<br/> the miracle at that time<br/> turn out?  A multitude<br/> of men was satisfied, <br/> and not a small one, <br/> for it extended to five<br/> thousand without<br/> women and children: <br/> this is what another<br/> of the holy<br/> evangelists added of<br/> his own to these<br/> words<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.

Clearly a full assurance that the practice of hospitality<br/> has a rich recompense from God.  But it is also possible to see that the new wonders<br/> accord with the older ones,  and are the activities of one and the same power. <br/> He rained manna in the desert for those from Israel,  “He gave them bread<br/> from heaven and a human ate the bread of angels,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Psalm 77:24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;25 LXX&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> according to what is sung in<br/> the Psalms.  But see,  again in the desert he generously supplied food for<br/> those in need,  as if he brought it down from heaven.  For multiplying<br/> the small amount,  as if from nothing,  to feed such a great multitude<br/> would not be dissimilar to the first sign.❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
