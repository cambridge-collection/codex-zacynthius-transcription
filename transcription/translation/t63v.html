He did not immediately say,  “You,  who do you say that I am?” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 9:20&lt;/span&gt;">*</span></span><br/> Rather,  he refers back to the report of those who were outside so that,  having rejected it and<br/> shown it to be disreputable,  he might shepherd them in future to the true opinion.  This is<br/> indeed what was done.  For when the disciples said,  “Some say John the Baptist, <br/> but others Elijah;  and still others that one of the ancient prophets has arisen, <br/>”  he said to them,  “But you,  who do you say that I am?” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 9:19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Ah,  how important is the<br/> “you”!  He places them outside the others,  so that they might also escape their<br/> suspicions and not have an unworthy opinion about him.  He says “you”, <br/> the chosen ones,  who have been called to apostleship by a decree from me, <br/> who are witnesses of the miracles I have wrought.  “Who do you say I am?”  But again, </div><div class="column col-left"> Peter leaps before the<br/> others and becomes a<br/> mouthpiece of the whole<br/> company.

For there are very many people who have been called christs from<br/> their anointing by God in different ways.  Some were anointed to be rulers, <br/> others prophets.  Others,  meaning us,  have received redemption through Christ, <br/> the Saviour of us all,  and have been anointed with the Holy Spirit and so have taken<br/> on the appellation of christ.  Therefore there are very many christs,  but they are called<br/> this after the deed:  there is one and only one who is from God the Father.  It is not as if<br/> we are really christs,  and not those of God but rather of someone else:  but as he<br/> and he alone has as his own Father the one in heaven.  Therefore it is clear that, <br/> distinguishing him from the multitude of others,  Peter related him to the Father,  as<br/> being his alone.  He was God by nature and shone forth ineffably from God the Father;  his<br/> only-begotten Word became flesh according to what is written. <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.
