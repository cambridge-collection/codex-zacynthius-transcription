He did not immediately say, “  You, who do you say that I am? ” </span><br/> Rather,  he refers back to the report of those who were outside,  that having rejected it and<br/> shown it to be disreputable,  he might shepherd them in future to the true opinion.  This is indeed<br/> what he did.  For when the disciples said, “  Some say John the Baptist, <br/> others Elijah,  others that a prophet from those of the ancients has<br/> arisen, ”  he said to them, “  But you,  who do you say that I am? ”  Ah,  how important is the“  You” !  It places them apart from the others,  so that they might escape the<br/> suspicions of such people and not have a small opinion about him.  He says“  You” , <br/> the chosen ones,  who have been called to apostleship by the choice in me, <br/> who are witnesses of the miracles I have wrought. “  Whom do you say I am? ”  But again,</div><div class="column col-left"> Peter leaps before<br/> the others and becomes<br/> a mouth of the whole<br/> group.

' </div><div class="column col-full"> an accurate confession of faith in him,  saying, “  The Christ of God. ” <br/> The disciple is unerring,  for he does not then say simply that he is Christ from God,  but rather<br/> the Christ.  For there are very many people who have been called christs from their anointing<br/> by God in different ways.  Some were anointed to be rulers, <br/> others prophets.  Other have also received redemption through him,  the Christ,  the Saviour<br/> of us all,  meaning that we have been anointed with the holy Spirit<br/> and have taken on the calling of Christ.  Accordingly,  there are very many christs,  but they are called<br/> this after the deed.  there is one and only one who is from the God and Father.  It is not as if<br/> we are truly christs,  nor rather those of God,  but of someone else:  he and he alone, <br/> however,  has as Father the one in the Heavens.  Therefore it is clear<br/> that,  distinguishing him from the multitude of others,  Peter related him to the Father,  as<br/> being his alone.  He was God by nature and shone forth unspeakably from God the Father;  his<br/> only-begotten word became flesh according to what is written.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
