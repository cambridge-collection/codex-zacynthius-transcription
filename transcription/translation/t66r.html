Therefore the presence of Moses and Elijah and their speaking to each other<br/> was some sort of dispensation which showed very well how our Lord Jesus the Christ<br/> was flanked by the law and the prophets,  as he was master of both the law and the prophets: <br/> he was also revealed in advance by them,  and through them,  in harmony with each other, <br/> they heralded in advance.  But the blessed disciples sleep for a short time<br/> while the Lord spent time in prayer,  for he purposefully fulfilled what was<br/> human.  Then,  having woken,  they became observers of a most noble and marvellous<br/> change.  The divine Peter,  perhaps thinking that somehow the moment of the<br/> kingdom of God had arrived,  approves staying on the mountain and says that<br/> three tents should be made:  one for Christ and the others for Moses and Elijah. </div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:27</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 58</span></span><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> <span class="cap">B</span>ut truly I tell you, </span><br/> there are some standing here<br/> who will not taste<br/> death before they see the<br/> kingdom of God.’ </div><div class="column col-right"> But,  it says,  “He did not<br/> know what he was saying.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 9:33&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For<br/> it was not the moment of<br/> the consummation of the<br/> age,  nor indeed of the time<br/> for the saints to take<br/> their share of the hope<br/> which had been<br/> promised to them. </div><div class="column col-full"> For,  as Paul says,  “He will transform the body of our humiliation so that it may be<br/> conformed to the body of his glory,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Philippians 3:21&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> meaning Christ.
