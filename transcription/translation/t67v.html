The apostles made common cause with</span><br/> the prophets and together they beheld the glory of the king: “  This is<br/> my Son” ,  about whom Moses prophesied,  as did the prophets; “  This is the chosen<br/> one” ,  chosen not from many,  but when he even became Human: “  Listen<br/> to him. ”  Let Moses be silent in future,  let the prophets be silent.  Listen to him,  the one who<br/> was prophesied and has arrived,  that it is necessary to suffered,  that it is necessary to be<br/> crucified,  that it is necessary to be scorned and to share the death of Humans,  that it is necessary to rise<br/> on behalf of Humans,  that it is necessary to fulfil the entire dispensation,  that it is necessary that<br/> you yourselves are also tested and suffer much so that you may be sharers in glory.  For it is this<br/> glory which you have seen but are unable to share unless you suffer with the one who has been<br/> glorified.  ❧<span class="space tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;                                Space of 11 character(s)                                &lt;/span&gt;">                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Cyril</span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 260-2&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">60</span></span></span><span class="here"><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> </span> <span class="cap">H</span>e is therefore transfigured in front of them,  and we say that the transfiguration</span></div><div class="column col-left"> has taken place,  not<br/> because his body has<br/> cast off its human<br/> appearance in some<br/> way,  but because<br/> some glory in the form</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:29</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 60</span></span>¶ <span class="cap">A</span>nd he was praying while</span><br/> the appearance<br/> of his face changed</div><div class="column col-full"> of light shines around it,  and it changes the most dishonoured stamp of the flesh into<br/> a more noble sight,  in accordance with“  it is sown in dishonour,  it is raised in<br/> glory” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 15:43&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>,  as was well and rightly spoken by the blessed Paul.
