For as they were from the</span><br/> flock of the Jews,  they were outside the lazy and they were not inexperienced in the writings<br/> of Moses.  Indeed,  they had had been picked out by Christ because of this.  Then how were they unaware of the<br/> mystery of Christ,  even though it had been written in advance in very many places throughout the shadow of the law?

But see<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;The correction appears to be to an ungrammatical form&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>,  Christ examines the thoughts of the<br/> holy apostles and he fixes the eye of divinity on what is hidden.  And so,  indeed,  he is<br/> God who deserves such great and divine honours.  Except let us investigate<br/> this:  did all the blessed disciples have in common the sickness of this<br/> sort?  But I think that it is rather unbelievable that all of them thought the same thing and that a single<br/> sickness was immediately taken on.  Rather,  as I think,  when one of them suffered it,  so that he should not be found as<br/> appearing to be an accuser against one of his fellow disciples,  the most wise evangelist</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
