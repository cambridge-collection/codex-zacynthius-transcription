For arguing as to which of them is<br/> the greatest is altogether characteristic of one who is contentious and desires<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;The manuscript reads &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;επιθυμησαντα&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt; for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;επιθυμησαντος&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> to stand in front of<br/> the others.  Yet the one who knows how to save,  which is clearly Christ,  did not sleep.  He saw in the<br/> mind of the disciple the argument about this very matter,  like some “bitterness<br/> springing up,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Hebrews 12:15; cf. Deuteronomy 29:17&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> according to what is written.  Before it is lifted to the height,  before it grows to<br/> maturity,  he digs up the evil from its very root.  For passions which are beginning within us<br/> are easily conquered,  but those which have matured are hard to resist and shameful in no small<br/> measure.  How,  then,  does the physician of souls cut out the passion which longs for glory?  “He took<br/> a little child and put it by his side.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 9:47&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> He made the matter a reason of</div><div class="column col-left"> benefit both for<br/> the holy apostles<br/> themselves and also<br/> for us after them. <br/> For the sickness of</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:46</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 68</span></span><span class="cap">A</span>n argument arose among</span><br/> them as to which one of them<br/> was the greatest. </div><div class="column col-full"> this sort in general feeds on humans who are superior in some way compared to<br/> others.  So of what did he make the child who was brought forward a type and image?  Of a life<br/> without evil and without ambition.  For it has a mind which is without corruption,  a heart which<br/> is genuine.  It is simple in its thoughts:  it does not desire ambition;  it does not know<br/> the manner of superiority in any particular way,  but nor does it flee from seeming to be of lesser<br/> value.  It has much tranquillity in mind and heart,  from its simplicity and lack of evil. <br/> And indeed the Saviour himself once claimed to the holy apostles,  or rather to all those who<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> love him:  “Truly I say to you that unless you turn and become like these children,  you are<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> unable to enter into the kingdom of God.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 18:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> He accepts and loves those whose nature is such, <br/> and he considers them worthy to be kept near him as they have chosen to think his thoughts. <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> For he said,  “Learn from me that I am gentle and humble in heart” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 11:29&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>;  then he says that,  “whoever<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> welcomes this child in my name welcomes me,  whoever welcomes me</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
