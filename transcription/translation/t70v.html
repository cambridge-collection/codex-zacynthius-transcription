For simply considering the matter of who might be<br/> the greatest of them is the mark of a contentious person,  and one who desired to stand in front of<br/> the others.  Except that the one who knew how to save them did not sleep,  which is clearly Christ.  He saw in the<br/> understanding of the disciple the consideration on this very matter,  like something of bitterness<br/> springing up,  according to what is written.  And before it is lifted to the height,  before it is<br/> anchored by its root,  he digs up the evil.  For sufferings which are beginning within us<br/> are easily conquered,  but those which are anchored are hard to resist and more than averagely<br/> shameful.  So how does the doctor of souls cut out the passion of the desire for glory? “  He took<br/> a child and set it in the middle of them. ”  He made the matter the reason for</div><div class="column col-left"> benefit,  both for<br/> the holy apostles<br/> themselves and also<br/> for us after them. <br/> For the sickness of</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:46</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 68</span></span><span class="cap">A</span>n argument arose</span><br/> among them as to which one of them<br/> was the greatest. </div><div class="column col-full"> of this sort feeds on all Humans whoever might be in some sort of prominence with regard to<br/> others.  And so of what did he make the child who was brought forward a type and image?  Of a life which<br/> is without evil and without love of glory.  For it has a mind which is without trickery,  a heart which<br/> is without discord.  It is simple in its thoughts:  it does not desire love of glory;  it does not know<br/> the manner of pre-eminence in any particular way,  but nor does it flee from seeming to be of lesser<br/> value.  For it has much goodness in mind and heart,  as from its simplicity and lack of evil. <br/> And indeed the Saviour himself once claimed to the holy aposltes,  or rather to all those who<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> love him: “  Truly I say to you that unless you turn and become like these children, <br/> you are unable to enter into the kingdom of God. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 18:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> He approaches and loves those whose<br/> nature is such,  and he considers them worthy of being chosen to stand next to him,  as thinking the same as him.  For he said, <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span>“  Learn from me that I am gentle and humble in heart” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 11:29&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>;  then he says that, “  whoever will<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> receive this child in my name,  receives me.
