Do they begrudge those who are</span><br/> favoured?  Tell me,  do you forbid in the name of Christ the one who crushes evil spirits? <br/> Yet how should you not rather have considered that it was not that person themselves who was the<br/> doer of the marvel,  but the grace within them which performed the marvel,  clearly in the<br/> power of Christ.  How is it,  then?  Do you forbid the one who excels in Christ?  ‘Yes’,  he says, <br/> for “he does not follow with us.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 9:49&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> What does it matter if the one crowned by grace from Christ has<br/> not become numbered among the holy apostles?  Very many are the diversities of the<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> gifts from Christ.  The blessed Paul will also teach this,  saying that “To one is given<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> a word of wisdom;  to another a word of knowledge;  to another faith;  to someone else<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> gifts of healing.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 12:8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> What then is the meaning of “He does not walk with us”?  The Saviour<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> “gave authority to the holy apostles over unclean spirits,  that they</div><div class="column col-left"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> might cast them out<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and heal all sickness<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and every affliction<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> among the people.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 10:1&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And<br/> indeed they accomplished<br/> this and returned<br/> rejoicing and saying, <br/> “Lord,  in your name</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="cap">f</span>or the least among</span><br/> all of you is the<br/> greatest.’ <span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:49</span>John<br/> answered,  ‘Teacher, <br/> we saw someone casting</div><div class="column col-full"> even the demons submit to us.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 10:17&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Accordingly they thought that it was<br/> permitted to no-one else but them alone to bear the honour which was granted.  For this reason, <br/> the honoured ones approach<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Codex Zacynthius appears to read this verb as two words, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;προς&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;ϊασιν&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt; (those honoured &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;for healing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;), but this leaves the sentence without a verb.&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> to learn if others are also permitted to do this.  We have something<br/> of this nature also in the earlier writings,  I mean in the holy ones.  For God said to<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Moses somewhere,  “Choose for yourself 70 men from the elders of Israel,  and<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> I will take from the spirit which is on you and I will give it,”  he says,  “to them.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Numbers 11:16&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And the<br/> chosen people gathered at that ancient tabernacle,  except for two of them who remained<br/> in the assembly.  When the spirit of prophecy fell on them,  not only did those men<br/> prophesy who had come together in the holy tabernacle,  but also those who had remained<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> behind in the encampment.  And,  it says,  “Joshua,  who stood before Moses,  said ‘Eldad<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and Medad<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;The Septuagintal form used here is Modad&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> are prophesying in the encampment.  Lord Moses,  stop them.’ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
