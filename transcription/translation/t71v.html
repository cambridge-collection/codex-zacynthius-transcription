Do they begrudge those</span><br/> who have a good reputation?  Tell me,  do you forbid in the name of Christ the one who crushes evil<br/> spirits?  Then how should you not rather have thought that it was not that very person who was the<br/> doer of unexpected deed but the grace within him which brought about the unexpected,  clearly in the<br/> the power of Christ.  How,  then,  do you forbid the one who excels in Christ?  Yes,  he says, <br/> for he does not follow with us.  For what is it if the one crowned by grace from Christ has<br/> not become numbered among the holy apostles?  Very many are the differences of the<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> gifts from Christ.  The blessed Paul will also teach this,  saying that<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span>“  To one is given a word of wisom;  to another a word of knowledge;  to another faith;  to someone else<br/> gifts of healing. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 12:8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-el&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> What then is the point of“  He does not walk with us” ?  The Saviour<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span>“  gave authority to the holy apostles over unclean spirits, that they</div><div class="column col-left"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> might cast them out<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and heal all sickness<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and every affliction<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> among the people. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 10:1&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And<br/> they both accomplished<br/> this and returned<br/> rejoicing and saying, <br/>“  Lord,  even the demons</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="cap">f</span>or the least among all</span><br/> of you<br/> is the greatest. ' <span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:49</span>John<br/> answered, '  Teacher, <br/> we saw someone casting</div><div class="column col-full"> are subject to us in your name.  Accordingly they thought that to none<br/> of the others but to them alone was it permitted to bear the dignity given.  For this reason, <br/> those deemed worthy to heal learn if it is permitted for others to do this.  We have something<br/> of this nature also in the earlier writings,  I mean in the holy ones.  For God said to<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> Moses somewhere, “  Choose for yourself 70 men from the elders of Israel,  and<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> I will take from the Spirit which is on you and I will give it, ”  he says, “  to them. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Numbers 11:16&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And the<br/> chosen people gathered at that ancient tent,  except for two of them.  For they<br/> remained in the synagogue.  When the Spirit of prophecy fell on them,  not only<br/> did those men prophesy who had come together in the holy tent,  but also those who had remained<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> behind in the middle.  And,  it says, “  Joshua,  who stood beside Moses,  said ‘ Eldad<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and Medad<span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;The Septuagintal form used here is Modad&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> are prophesying in the middle.  Lord Moses,  stop them.  ’</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
