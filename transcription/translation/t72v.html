He made the scorn which they received from the Samaritans like a training for<br/> this occasion.  They did not receive the messengers:  it was necessary for the disciples who<br/> followed in the footsteps of the master rather to endure it in a holy fashion and not to say<br/> anything against them from anger.  But they were not such people;  instead,  they were somewhat hot-<br/>headed and overcome by zeal.  They wanted to bring down fire on them from heaven,  in respect of<br/> that which concerned them.
