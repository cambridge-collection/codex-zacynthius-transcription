Accordingly,  the master of all gives as<br/> a generous giver,  not simply to all in an indiscriminate way,  but especially to those<br/> who should be worthy to receive them.  If, then, an old man should wish to be considered worthy<br/> of such things,  let him put away from his soul the dirt which leads to meanness<br/> and accusations.  For thus he will be acceptable.

For he should have<br/> taken up his own cross,  meaning to die to the world.  He was considering<br/> renouncing the empty distractions of this present life:  for the friendship of the<br/> world is the enmity of God.  As the Human was of this nature,  Jesus examines him obliquely,  rather than</div><div class="column col-left"> reproaching him.

But the inner and hidden<br/> revelation comes through deeper understanding.  For he seemed to equate foxes<br/> and the birds of Heaven with wicked,  cunning and resisting powers, <br/> which are the herds of demons.  For they are called this in very many places<br/> by the divinely-inspired scripture.  The blessed Psalmist said about such people: <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span>“  They will be the portions of foxes. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Psalm 62:11&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> In the Song of Songs it is written: <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span>“  Catch for us the little foxes that wipe out the vines. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Song of Songs 2:15&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And Christ himself<br/> says about Herod somewhere, “  Say to that fox” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 13:32&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>.  And he also said,  with regard to<br/> the seeds which fell on the earth,  that“  The birds of the Heaven came and<br/> ate them up. ”  And we say that he did not say this about perceptible and<br/> visible birds,  but rather about unclean and wicked spirits. </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
