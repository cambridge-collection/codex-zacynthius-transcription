For he<br/> should have taken up his own cross,  meaning to die to the world or rather to<br/> renounce the empty distractions of this present life.  For the friendship of the world is<br/> the enmity of God.  As the man was this sort of person,  Jesus examines him obliquely,  not</div><div class="column col-left"> reproaching him but rather<br/> correcting him so that of his own<br/> accord he might become better. <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> For this reason he says that<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> “Foxes have holes<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> and birds of the<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> air have nests, </div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:57</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc chapternumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Chapter number&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="rubric">33</span></span></span><span class="cap">A</span>s they were going along</span><br/> the road,  someone said to<br/> him,  ‘I will follow you<br/> wherever you go.’ </div><div class="column col-full"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 9:58&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> On one hand,  the more<br/> straightforward meaning of these words is like that.  But the inner and hidden<br/> revelation comes through deeper understanding.  For he seems to be calling the<br/> wicked,  cunning and resisting powers,  which are the herds of demons, <br/> foxes and birds of heaven.  For they are called this in very many places<br/> by the divinely-inspired scripture.  The blessed Psalmist said about such people: <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> “They will be the portions of foxes.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Psalm 62:11 LXX&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> In the Song of Songs it is written: <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> “Catch for us the little foxes that wipe out the vines.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Song of Songs 2:15&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And Christ himself<br/> says about Herod somewhere,  “Say to that fox.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 13:32&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> And he also said somewhere about<br/> the seeds which fell on the earth,  that “The birds of the heaven came and<br/> ate them up.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 13:4&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> We claim that he did not say this about perceptible and<br/> visible birds,  but rather about unclean and wicked spirits. </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
