The God of everything has given full assurance,  saying about it<br/> through the holy prophets:  “Judgment will arise like couch-grass on the bare part of a<br/> field.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Hosea 10:4&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> For just as the couch-grass springs up in the parts of the field left bare,  it takes<br/> hold of them and spreads,  always pressing forwards across the whole place.  According<br/> to the saying,  equal to this is judgment,  meaning the grace which makes righteous the<br/> world under heaven,  that is the saving gospel message.  It has taken hold of every city<br/> and countryside.  Accordingly,  they were shown beforehand by Chris to be seventy in<br/> number,  in addition to the twelve.❧ </div><div class="column col-left"><span class="centrejust"><span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Cyril of Alexandria, Homily 60 on Luke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=3576&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 3576&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">From</span> <span class="rubric">Saint</span> <span class="rubric">Titus</span></span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 277-1&lt;/span&gt;">77</span></span> <span class="cap">F</span>or just as fields waving</span><br/> richly far and wide with crops<br/> seek many to harvest them, <br/> so the entire earth,  or<br/> rather the multitude of those<br/> who would believe in Christ, <br/> being great and beyond number, <br/> has need of more than a few<br/> instructors.  And so they were<br/> sent out two by two and went<br/> throughout the towns and<br/> villages,  with the cry which all<br/> but came from the voice of John, <br/> “Prepare the way of the Lord.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Matthew 3:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span><br/> Yet observe this:  he said<br/> “Ask the Lord of the harvest<br/> to send out labourers<br/> into his harvest,” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 10:2&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> but<br/> he has done this himself. <br/> Although who else would be<br/> the Lord of the harvest, </div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text">and sent them on ahead<br/> of him in twos to every<br/> town and place where<br/> he himself intended<br/> to go. <span class="space tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;                                Space of 1 character(s)                                &lt;/span&gt;">                        &nbsp;</span><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">10:2</span>He said to<br/> them,  ‘The harvest is<br/> plentiful,  but the labourers<br/> are few;  therefore ask the<br/> Lord of the harvest to<br/> send labourers out into his<br/> harvest. <span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">10:3</span>Go on your way. </div><div class="column col-full"> meaning of those on the earth,  except the one who by nature is truly God?

Then how did Christ appoint these workers<br/> for a mission which befits only the God who is over all?  He,  indeed,  is the master of the harvest<br/> himself,  and through him and with him,  God the Father reigns over all.
