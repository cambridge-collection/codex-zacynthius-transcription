For when the divine sign followed the word,  no manner of<br/> vexatiousness would have prevailed against them:  the grace of the Spirit accordingly bore<br/> witness to those who had been sent,  that they were not self-called or self-appointed to the<br/> duty of speaking about Christ.  ❧<span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">And</span> <span class="rubric">a</span> <span class="rubric">little</span> <span class="rubric">later</span> <span class="rubric">on</span></span>“  Lord,  even the demons are subject<br/> to us in your name. ”  For they confess the authority of the one who honoured them, <br/> but they seem to rejoice,  not because they had become ministers of the proclamations<br/> about him and had been considered worthy of apostolic gifts,  but rather because they had become fulfillers<br/> of signs.
