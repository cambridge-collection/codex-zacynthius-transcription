For all the individuality of the Father belongs to the word which was born from him by nature<br/> and in truth.  Accordingly, he saw through the effectiveness of the Spirit which he had given to<br/> those who were worthy,  whom he also ordered to minister the divine proclamation.  He saw that many had<br/> been drawn into the net;  signs worthy of wonder had been accomplished through them,  and finally<br/> that what was under the heaven was in the beginnings of salvation through him,  I mean salvation through<br/> faith.  And for this reason he rejoiced in the holy Spirit,  meaning at the<br/> effectiveness and power which came through the holy Spirit,  knowing well that those who were sent by him</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">10:21</span><span class="pageleft"><span class="tooltip-struc vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;"> +78</span></span><span class="cap">A</span>t that same hour</span><br/> Jesus rejoiced in the Holy <span class="overline">Spirit</span><br/> and said,  I thank<br/> you <span class="overline">Father</span>,  <span class="overline">Lord</span> of<br/> heaven and earth, </div><div class="column col-right"> had been of benefit to many<br/> people.  ❧<span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">And</span> <span class="rubric">a</span> <span class="rubric">little</span> <span class="rubric">later</span> <span class="rubric">on</span></span><br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span><span class="here"><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> </span> <span class="cap2">I</span> confess you,  Father, <br/> Lord of Heaven and earth. <br/> He says“  I confess”  in<br/> a human manner,  instead<br/> of“  I acknowledge a gift” , <br/> or rather“  I glorify you” ,  for<br/> it is the custom in the inspired<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> scripture to accept it this way. <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> It is written,  indeed,  that<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span>“  They shall confess your great<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> name,  Lord,  because it is<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> fearsome and holy. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Psalm 98:3&lt;/span&gt;">*</span><br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> And again, “  I will confess</div><div class="column col-full"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> you,  Lord,  in all my heart:  I will tell of all your wonders. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Psalm 9:2&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> But see,  say<br/> those who are distorted in their understanding,  the Son acknowledges thanks to the Father.  How, then,  is he not<br/> lower than him?  To this,  one of those who is well-versed in the opinions which fortify the truth<br/> might say:  And what is it,  noble ones,  which prevents the consubstantial Son from approving<br/> and praising his own Father,  who saved that which is under the heaven through him?  But if you<br/> think through his confession that he is in a lower state than the Father,  look also at what<br/> follows,  for he calls the Father Lord of Heaven and earth.  But the Son of the God who rules over<br/> all things is master with him,  in some all-encompassing way,  of all things and is above everything. </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
