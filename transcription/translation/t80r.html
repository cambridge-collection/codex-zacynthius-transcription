He sets up clearly how great a benefit has happened in consequence for those on the earth:  ›<br/>“  Everything, ”  he says, “  has been handed over to me by my Father. ”  For while he was and is Lord<br/> of both heaven and earth,  and enthroned with the Father and co-ruler with him of all things,  when<br/> he sent himself down to our situation he had dealings as a Human.  Again,  his conversation<br/> is not unseemly for the disposition with flesh,  and he does not refuse to speak words which<br/> befit the extent of his self-emptying,  so that he might be believed as having become like<br/> us and having taken up our poverty.
