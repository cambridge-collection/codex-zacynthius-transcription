But<br/> after saying this,  he rises<br/> immediately to his own glory<br/> and superiority,  and he<br/> demonstrates that in no way<br/> is he inferior to his own Father. <br/> For what did he say in addition<br/> to those words?  › “No-one knows<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> who the Son is except<br/> the Father,  or who the Father is</div><div class="column col-full"><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 10:22&lt;/span&gt;">*</span><span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;The next sentence is not found in the Syriac version of this sermon.&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Accordingly,  let those who<br/> take the first words as subordination of the Son learn through these words the indistinguishability<br/> of the Son with regard to his own Father in every single thing whatsoever.  For how when, <br/> according to what he says,  no-one knows the Son except the Father alone,  have you yourselves<br/> dared both to think and to say that he is inferior to him,  as if you knew him accurately?  And<br/> how is the one who is known only by his own Father not beyond all things,  even speech,  just<br/> as doubtless the Father himself also is,  who is known only by his own offspring?  For the<br/> holy and consubstantial Trinity alone knows itself,  which is also beyond all understanding<br/> and speech.  But the Son reveals this to us through the Spirit,  as the Apostle also says, <br/> “For God has revealed this to us through his Spirit.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 2:10&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>❧ </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
