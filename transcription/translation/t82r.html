You address him as teacher,  but you are not prepared to learn.  You pretend to<br/> honour him,  expecting to catch him.  Observe for me,  again,  the malice in the words<br/> of the lawyer.  For it would have been possible to say,  ‘ What should I do to be saved?  ’ meaning to please God and<br/> receive a reward from him.  But he rejects that,  and instead rather uses the words<br/> of the Saviour,  pouring ridicule on his own head.  For since<br/> it was the custom of Christ,  the Saviour of everyone,  frequently to converse about eternal life<br/> with those who approached him,  the egotistical lawyer,  in order to ridicule him,  as I have said, <br/> used his own words.

But since you are<br/> testing him in a wicked way, <br/> you will hear nothing other<br/> than simply what was<br/> prophesied by Moses to<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> those of old.  For he<br/> says, “  What is written in<br/> the law?
