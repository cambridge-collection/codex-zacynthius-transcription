You pretend to<br/> honour him,  expecting to catch him.’  Observe again,  I ask you,  the malice in the words<br/> of the lawyer.  For it would have been possible to say,  ‘What must I do to be saved,  or at<br/> least to please God and receive the reward from him?’.  But he let that go,  and used rather<br/> the words of the Saviour,  to pour ridicule on his head.  For since it was the custom<br/> of Christ,  the Saviour of everyone,  constantly to converse about eternal life with those<br/> who approached him,  the egotistical lawyer,  in order to ridicule him,  as I have said, <br/> used his words.  ‘But if you had been truly keen to learn,  you would have heard from him</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">10:25</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">97</span></span></span><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> <span class="cap">J</span>ust then a lawyer</span><br/> stood up to test Jesus. <br/> ‘Teacher,’  he said, <br/> ‘what must I do to<br/> inherit eternal life?’ </div><div class="column col-right"> things that lead to eternal<br/> life:  since you are<br/> testing him in a wicked way, <br/> you will hear nothing other<br/> than simply what was<br/> prophesied by Moses to<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> those of old.’  For he<br/> says,  “What is written in<br/> the law?
