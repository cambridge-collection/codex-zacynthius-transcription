For the priest and the Levite indicate this, <br/> as the law is what brings in levitical holiness.  But while it oversaw,  it was exhausted<br/> and it was not sufficient for complete healing.  It did not make what was lying down to stand,  and<br/> as it was exhausted it necessarily retreated without taking a step.
