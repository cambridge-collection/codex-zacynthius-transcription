For since</span><br/> he was having a conversation with the lawyer, who bragged greatly with regard to the law, <br/> he was keen to set him in his place by what was said.  So not the priest,  not the Levite,  not(  to put<br/> it simply)  those who thought that they behaved according to the laws of Moses,  but it was he who came<br/> to fulfil the intention of the law.  He revealed by his very works who is the neighbour, <br/> and what it means to love them as oneself.  The Jews said of him in scorn, “  You<br/> are a Samaritan and you have a demon” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;John 8:48&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> and they accused him very frequently of breaking<br/> the law.  ❧<span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">And</span> <span class="rubric">a</span> <span class="rubric">little</span> <span class="rubric">later</span> <span class="rubric">on</span>. </span><span class="here"><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> </span> <span class="cap">T</span>he Samaritan on his journey,  who is Christ,  saw the man lying</div><div class="column col-left"> there.
