For there are many prayers in antiquity,  and seeing the practice of<br/> the Saviour as going above every behaviour of every righteous person and<br/> prophet,  they asked for a model of prayer.  And it is well that they ask from Jesus how<br/> they should speak wisely to the Father.  For no-one is able to speak about the<br/> Father except the one alone who is from him.  So if someone were to speak so that we should not err towards God<br/> in asking for some things in place of others,  or converse with him in an unsuitable way,  or address<br/> God through prayer in a manner not as it should be, “  Teach us to<br/> pray. ”  ❧<span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">And</span> <span class="rubric">again</span></span> There are two manners of prayer,  my beloved.
