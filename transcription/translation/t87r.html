The Saviour instructed them to do this too:  they make<br/> their approach free from all blame.  For observe what sort of sense is concealed in these<br/> words,  through which he instructed them to ask for bread which is daily food:  it should be clear<br/> from this that he did not allow them to possess anything,  but rather to practise a poverty<br/> which befits the holy.  For asking is not for those who have possessions,  but for those who are<br/> in need.  If someone who was in need of nothing were to say to God,  who knows everything,  ‘Give<br/> us today our everyday bread’ <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.
