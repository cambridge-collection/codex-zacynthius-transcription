For it is written about then, “  Bless the Lord,  all his<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> powers,  ministers of him who do his will. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Psalm 102:21&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> Accordingly,  those who say<br/> this encourage strength to be given to those on the earth,  that they might do the<br/> will of God and they might become imitators of the behaviour above and in the heavens, <br/> I mean among the holy angels.  As Paul says,  as they walk around on earth“  may they<br/> have their citizenship in Heaven. ” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.

For,  as I have said,  the will of the God who is over all is that everyone on the earth should behave<br/> in a holy fashion.  This is so that the church on the earth may be seen as the imitator and image<br/> of the church of the firstborn which,  I say,  is above and may please Christ.  ❧<span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">From</span> <span class="rubric">the</span> <span class="rubric">same</span> <span class="rubric">Cyril</span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 311-1&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline"><span class="rubric">11</span></span></span></span><span class="here"><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> </span> <span class="cap2">P</span>erhaps some people think that it is unfitting and unsuitable for holy people to ask for bodily things</span></div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">11:3</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> <span class="rubric">11</span></span></span>¶ <span class="cap">G</span>ive us each</span><br/> day our<br/> daily bread. </div><div class="column col-right"> from God,  and for this<br/> reason,  they divert the<br/> saying into a spiritual<br/> consideration.

They make<br/> their approach free from all blame.  For observe what sort of intention is concealed in these<br/> words,  through which he instructed them to ask for bread,  which would from this clearly<br/> be food for a day.  He did not allow them to possess anything,  but rather to practise a poverty<br/> which befits the holy.  For asking is not for those who have possessions,  but for those who<br/> are in need.  If someone who was in need of nothing were to say to God,  who knows everything, <br/>“  Give us today our everyday bread, ”  they might seem to be being ironic or, indeed,  to wish<br/> truly to take it.
