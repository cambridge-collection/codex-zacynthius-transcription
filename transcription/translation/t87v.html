But if it were true that, <br/> when they pray,  they are calling to mind bread which will be given in the age to<br/> come,  why do they precede it in addition with the phrase“  Give us each day” ?  For<br/> by these words it is possible to see that they are making a request for daily food, <br/> clearly as those who are poor. <span class="here"><span class="tooltip-struc" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Paragraph marker&lt;/span&gt;">￣</span> </span> <span class="cap2">T</span>he word ‘ supersubstantial ’ should be understood as ‘ self-sufficient ’.
