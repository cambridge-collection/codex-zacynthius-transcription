So in this manner is the holy Virgin a kinswoman of Elizabeth.❧ <span class="comment_source tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Severus of Antioch, Sermon 63&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;https://clavis.brepols.net/clacla/OA/Link.aspx?clavis=CPG&amp;number=7035&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Link to CPG 7035&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;">*</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip-struc source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> And a little later on</span>.❧ <br/><span class="hang"> <span class="cap">T</span>he angel said to the Virgin “See,  Elizabeth your kinswoman” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Luke 1:36&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> as a special token of recognition. </span><br/> But as he was a minister of divine oracles and spiritual commands,  he did not simply<br/> say this.
