I believe<br/> that the virgin was not unaware of her partnership with the Holy Spirit.  And this this reason she also<br/> eagerly submitted and straightaway hurried off to Elizabeth.  For since Christ<br/> was also the ruler of the rulers,  just so indeed is he God and Lord of everything.  The chief priest<br/> himself pronounced an oracle when he became human,  offering himself as a sacrifice and offering<br/> purifying the sin of the world.  And our confession in him from the priests<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> both to himself and to the Father.  For Paul says, “  Observe well the apostle and chief priest<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> of our confession,  Jesus. ” :  this was predisposed from the beginning that he should belong to the kingly<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> tribe of Judah and the priestly tribe of Levi,  so that Christ might be derived as king and high<br/> priest from each side in what concerned the flesh.  For it is written in Exodus: “  Before</div><div class="column col-left"> the command was<br/> imposed which forbade<br/> taking a wife from<br/> another tribe, <br/> like Aaron,  who<br/> was the first High Priest</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">1:36</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 38</span></span>and now your relation Elizabeth in her old age<br/> has also conceived a son</div><div class="column col-full"> according to the law,  took as his wife Elizabeth from the tribe of Judah,  the daughter of<br/> Aminadab.  Aminadab was descended from Judah,  and so that no-one should consider<br/> another Aminadab in error,  they are shown this mostly clearly in the<br/> holy writing which says“  Daughter of Aminadab and sister of Naason”  and see for me the all-<br/> wise ordering of the Spirit who also arranged that this,  the wife of Zechariah,  the mother of the<br/> the Baptist and the relative of Mary the God-bearer, should be named<br/> Elizabeth and lead us back to that Elizabeth whom Aaron married<br/> and through whom the unification of the two tribes began,  and who calls distinctly through her<br/> name,  that for me she is from that Elizabeth,  who is the kinswoman to the Virgin.  And let<br/> no-one say that the Babylonian captivity confounded the Jewish people,  so that<br/> there were no races or tribes left afterwards which could be properly called.
