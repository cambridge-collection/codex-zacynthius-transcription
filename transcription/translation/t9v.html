I believe that<br/> the Virgin was not unaware that she was in partnership with the Holy Spirit.  This is why<br/> she too submitted eagerly and hurried off straightaway to Elizabeth.  For since Christ was<br/> also the ruler of the rulers,  just so indeed is he God and Lord of everything.  The chief priest<br/> himself pronounced an oracle when Christ became human,  offering himself as a sacrifice and<br/> an offering which purifies the sin of the world,  and the acknowledgment in him of us by what is<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> consecrated both to himself and to the Father.  For Paul says,  “Observe well the apostle and chief<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> priest of our confession,  Jesus.” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Hebrews 3:1&lt;/span&gt;">*</span> This was predisposed from the beginning that he should belong<br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> to the kingly tribe of Judah and the priestly tribe of Levi,  so that Christ might be descended<br/> as king and high priest from each side in what concerned the flesh.  For it is written in Exodus, </div><div class="column col-left"> before the command was<br/> imposed which prohibited<br/> taking a wife from<br/> another tribe, <br/> how Aaron,  who<br/> was the first high priest</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="tooltip-struc versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">1:36</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip-struc sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;"> 38</span></span>and now your relation Elizabeth<br/> in her old age has also conceived<br/> a son</div><div class="column col-full"> according to the law,  “took as his wife Elizabeth from the tribe of Judah,  the daughter of<br/> Aminadab” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;cf.

Aminadab was descended from Judah:  so that no-one should erroneously assume<br/> that this was another Aminadab,  the sacred text continues showing it more clearly:  say<br/> “daughter of Aminadab but sister of Naason” <span class="editorial-note tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Exodus 6:23&lt;/span&gt;">*</span>.  Consider,  I ask you,  the all- wise dispensation<br/> of the Spirit who also brought it about that this woman,  the wife of Zechariah,  the<br/> mother of the Baptist and the relative of Mary the God-bearer,  should also be named<br/> Elizabeth and lead us back to that Elizabeth whom Aaron married and through whom<br/> the unification of the two tribes began.  I think that through her name she distinctly<br/> proclaims that the kinswoman to the Virgin is descended from this Elizabeth.  Let<br/> no-one say that the Babylonian captivity confounded the Jewish people such that<br/> there was no distinction of races or tribes afterwards.
