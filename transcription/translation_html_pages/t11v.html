For every fruit from the substance of the fruit-bearing tree<br/> has sprouted,  and it is of the same nature to it and not from anything else. <br/> So,  they say,  how could the body of Emmanuel not be from Mary?  Fool!  But<br/> you have rejected the womb which produced the blessed and true fruit, <br/> and you invent an apparition,  the mother of some non-existent phantom,  and you make<br/> our salvation a phantom and a dream.  For if woman was of the same substance as Adam, or<br/> was taken from his flank and created,  and sin is derived from her, <br/> erring in the transgression of the commandment with him,  the Virgin too<br/> was in all ways of the the same substance.  From her,  Christ, the second Adam,  has risen up,  who takes away the<br/> sin of the world,  so that“  those who have died in Adam might be made alive in Christ” </div><div class="column col-left"> as the Apostle<br/> says.  ❧<br/><span class="centrejust"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From an unattributed source: </span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 045-1&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">45</span></span></span> <span class="cap2">S</span>he utters a sound harmonious</span></div><div id="biblical" class="column col-right biblical_text"><span class="tooltip versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">1:43</span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;">46</span></span>And why has this happened to me, that<br/>the<span class="overline">mother</span>of<span class="overline">the Lord</span>comes to me? </div><div class="column col-full"> to her son.

So<br/> while the divine ordering brought forth testimony to Elizabeth,  so that the testimony<br/> of John from his mother to the Lord should also be fulfilled through his own<br/> mother,  the visit of the Virgin to her relative<br/> had its haste.  For she came to see Elizabeth and the paradoxical<br/> embryo in her,  according to the voice of the angel,  so that through this the childbirth<br/> might be believed more greatly.  I say that what came from the virgin herself and ran to meet this<br/> faith was the word of Elizabeth saying“  And blessed is the woman who believes that there shall be<br/> a complete of the things that are spoken to her from the Lord.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
