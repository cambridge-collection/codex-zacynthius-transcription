For he earlier made the sons of Israel cross over<br/> the Jordan,  and then straightaway he sat and circumcised them with stone knives.  For is it not so when we<br/> cross over the Jordan,  then Christ circumcises us in the power of the Spirit:  he does not<br/> cleanse the flesh but rather cuts out the defilement in souls.
