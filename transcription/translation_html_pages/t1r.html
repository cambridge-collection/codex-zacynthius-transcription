And when they encounter the section of the heretics<br/> notes are set down there which are for avoiding,  as there are teachings in them<br/> unharmonious with church tradition,  having been spoken by the<br/> heretics.  And I did not do this of my own accord,  having followed<br/> our most holy father,  the archbishop of the great and Christ-loving city<br/> of Alexandria,  Cyril,  who says in his Letter to Eulogius: <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> One ought not to avoid and refuse everything which the heretics say. <br/><span class="lineleft"> ›</span> For they grant many things which we also grant.  And I thought<br/> that it was indispensable to add this to the present introduction as a clarification<br/> and distinction for those who encounter it.  For they should know that those<br/> who have interpreted God-inspired scripture have not only<br/> been carried in different ways in their ideas<br/> but,  indeed,  have not divided the very words of the same divine<br/> scripture identically,  and have contributed their interpretation in this manner.  For<br/> they have made their exposition with one of them combining more words and another fewer: <br/> the numbers which are assigned to the chapters are an indication of this, <br/> to provoke those who read the text to go further forwards. <br/><span class="hang"> <span class="cap2">A</span>ccordingly,  one ought to read the first and second and even third chapter</span><br/> of the text of the divine scripture,  and the accompanying interpretation in this manner<br/> so that the ideas are easily taken in for those who encounter them. </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
