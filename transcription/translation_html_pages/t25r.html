It is not the trial<br/> which has made you into chaff,  but it has proven that you are chaff and vain and faithless. <br/> But whenever a trial happens you will endure the trial.  It is not the trial<br/> which has made you faithful and enduring,  but it has brought to light the power of<br/> endurance which is within you.  ❧<span class="space tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Space of 4 character(s)&lt;/span&gt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Cyril ❧</span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 115-2&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">15</span></span></span> <span class="cap">S</span>ee,  then,  says the blessed Baptist,  that he differs from Christ as a master to the threshing-floor. </span><br/> For he too purifies it in this way,  separating and distinguishing the chaff from the grain. </div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
