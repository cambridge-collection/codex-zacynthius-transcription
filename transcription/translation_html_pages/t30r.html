Accordingly,<br/> let us too welcome Jesus,  for whenever he enters and we have him among us<br/> in our mind and heart,  then he will quench the fever of unsuitable<br/> pleasures.  But he also raises up those who are strong,  he appears manifestly in a spiritual way,<br/> so that they also minister to him,  meaning that they fulfil what is appropriate for him. <br/> Observe, too, for me,  how much benefit the touch of his holy flesh possesses. </div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="tooltip versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">4:38</span><span class="pageright"><span class="tooltip vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;">+31</span></span><span class="pageleft"><span class="tooltip vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;">31</span></span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip chapternumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Chapter number (chapter 9)&lt;/span&gt;">9</span></span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;">42</span></span></span></span>After leaving the synagogue<br/>he entered Simon's house. <br/>Now Simon's mother in law was suffering<br/>from a high fever, <br/>and they asked him<br/>about her. <span class="tooltip versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">4:39</span>Then he stood<br/>over her and rebuked<br/>the fever and it left<br/>her. </div><div class="column col-right"> For it drives away both<br/> diverse diseases and<br/> a crowd of demons, <br/> and it overthrows<br/> the power of the<br/> devil.
