But we say that weeping</span><br/> is not simply the teardrop which comes from the eyes,  for this is common and<br/> characteristic of all,  believers and unbelievers,  if something were to come to pass of the customary things which cause<br/> grief.  Rather it is those who shun a life which is joyful and refined and among<br/> luxuries,  meaning fleshly things.  For we say that these are in rejoicing and<br/> laughter,  but the others who decline luxurious living and fleshly propensities<br/> and weep all night because they hate what is in the world,  these the Saviour says are<br/> blessed.  Accordingly,  having commanded us to be poor, he garlands with honours the things which follow<br/> poverty.  These are the lack of necessities for nourishment,  and being downcast through<br/> affliction.  For it is written that“  The afflictions of the righteous are many,  and the Lord<br/> will save them from all of them. ”  ❧<span class="space tooltip" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Space of 10 character(s)&lt;/span&gt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From the same ❧</span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 173-1&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">73</span></span></span> <span class="cap">A</span>lready he announces the persection;  before sending the apostles away,  the gospel</span></div><div class="column col-left"> anticipated the final<br/> event.
