In the same way now,  too,  in the new covenant,  many wished to write gospels<br/> but the trustworthy stewards did not approve everyone.  Instead they chose some of them,  and<br/> before long the failed attempts of those who came to the composition of gospels without the gift<br/> have fallen into oblivion.  For Matthew did not make a failed attempt but wrote<br/> from the Holy Spirit,  just as Mark and John did also,  and equally Luke as well.  However, <br/> those who wrote the Gospel according to the Egyptians and the Gospel<br/> according to the Twelve failed in their attempts.  Basilides also dared to write<br/> the Gospel according to Basilides.  On one hand,  then,  many made failed attempts(  for it is said that there is also a Gospel<br/> according to Thomas and one according to Matthias and many others) ,  but the church of God<br/> prefers the four Gospels.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
