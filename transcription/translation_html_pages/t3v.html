For he is fully assured and did not doubt in any matter</span><br/> whether it was the case or not.  This is the case with regard to those who have firm faith.  For<br/> the Apostle also speaks about those who are firm: “  So that you may be rooted and established in<br/> faith” .  Nothing is as fully assured in this way as the mind and the word.  For appearance does not fully assure,  since<br/> matters are not assessed from signs and visible wonders,  but they are assessed by word<br/> as to which are true and which are false.  Insofar as Jesus embodied the role<br/> of his incarnate presence not as a fantasy(  according to the followers of the<br/> heretics)  but by encountering the truth,  he brought matters to the truth.  ❧<br/><span class="centrejust"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From an unattributed source.  ❧</span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 005-1&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">5</span></span></span> <span class="cap2">S</span>o he clearly acknowledges that he received from those who saw with their own eyes and</span><br/> heard it themselves.
