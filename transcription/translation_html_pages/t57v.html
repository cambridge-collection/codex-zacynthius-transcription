It happened,  however,  that this was what<br/> the woman did,  which is the reason that she is sought by the Lord.  He calls the disciples to his presence,  even<br/> though they do not know what is being sought,  but think that the Lord is speaking about a single<br/> touch,  of the same nature as all the others touched.  For this reason, the Lord explains<br/> and says, “  Someone touched me” ,  just as he also said“  The one who has ears to hear,  let them hear”  even though<br/> everyone has this sort of bodily hearing and all hear up to the bare<br/> hearing of the words.  But it was neither possible to hear what was not intelligible, <br/> nor to touch what was not credible.  So why does he call into his presence and raise his holy<br/> eyes to inspect the woman?  Because she is worthy of the Lord’s sight.  She is also worthy of<br/> demonstration to those who are present,  because she would be an example of faith to all<br/> and an encouragement to faith through the praise which would rightly be given to her.  ❧<div class="column col-left"><span class="centrejust"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Cyril</span></span><br/><span></span><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 241-2&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">41</span></span></span> <span class="cap">S</span>o did the Lord in his</span><br/> desire for fame not allow<br/> to go unnoticed the display</div><div class="column col-full"> of divine activity or the unexpected event which happened to the woman?  We do not<br/> claim this,  but rather the following.  He is everywhere looking to the benefit of those who are called<br/> to grace through faith.  Accordingly,  while the sign which is not recognised has done wrong to<br/> many,  it has benefitted in no small way the sort of person who is familiar and above all the leader<br/> of the synagogue.  For he began to set his hope more securely on what was<br/> expected,  and he granted stronger courage because Christ would also rescue his daughter<br/> from the snares of death.  So we know that God is Emmanuel and does not need eyes which<br/> see to understand everything,  nor does he have a perceptible understanding<br/> of affairs,  but it is beyond bodily perception.  ❧<br/><span class="centrejust"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip source" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Extract source&lt;/span&gt;"> From Saint Severus,  Archbishop of Antioch, from Sermon 51</span></span><br/><span class="hang"><span class="lineleft"><span tabindex="0" class="tooltip exnum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena extract 241-3&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="overline">41</span></span></span><span class="here"><span class="tooltip" title="Paragraph marker">￣</span> </span> <span class="cap">H</span>e inquired“  Who touched me? ”  not because he did not know the woman who touched him,  but because</span><br/> he wished through the inquiry to make public the touch which was only noticed by him.  Of course, <br/> the disciples were also at a loss.  For there were many people who were pressing hard,  or indeed<br/> touching,  to say it properly.  He called out, “  Someone touched me.  For I realised that power<br/> had gone out of me. ”  The power which he said had gone out was the activity of healing which<br/> she had drawn out by faith and the cures which she had drawn up as if from a flowing well.  ❧</div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
