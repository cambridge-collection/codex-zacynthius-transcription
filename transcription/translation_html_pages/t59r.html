For to those who wish to</span><br/> establish their life as all-holy and sacred,  as far as is possible for Humans,  Christ<br/> makes them bright with the gifts from himself;  he grants a rich recompense to them<br/> which matches the holiness of what they have established,  and he sets them up as<br/> sharers of his personal glory.  Accept the clear and effective demonstration of the<br/> matter.  See how the holy apostles have become most pre-eminent and crowned with<br/> glory which exceeds the Human,  when Christ gives this also to them after the<br/> others.  For,  it says,  he gave them“  power and authority over all demons,  and<br/> the ability to heal sicknesses. ”  But see again the incarnation of the</div><div id="biblical" class="column col-left biblical_text"><span class="hang"><span class="tooltip versenum" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Biblical reference&lt;/span&gt;">9:1</span><span class="pageright"><span class="tooltip vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;">+64</span></span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip vaticannumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Vatican number&lt;/span&gt;">64</span></span><span class="pageleft"><span class="tooltip sectionnumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Catena section&lt;/span&gt;">49</span></span></span></span><span class="colleft"><span class="tooltip chapternumber" title="&lt;span lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;tooltip-en&quot;&gt;Chapter number&lt;/span&gt;">27</span></span><span class="cap">T</span>hen Jesus called the</span><br/>twelve apostles and gave them<br/>power and authority<br/>over all demons<br/>and to cure diseases, </div><div class="column col-right"> word of God:  it<br/> exceeds the measure<br/> of humanity and is<br/> prominent in the<br/> honours of divinity. <br/> For it is beyond<br/> the measures of<br/> humanity and</div><div class="column col-full"> of God alone to grant authority over unclean spirits to those one may wish, <br/> and also the ability to free those who are in the grip of sicknesses. <br/> For both the prominence and the glory of the nature in the highest is not<br/> within any physical beings except for him alone.
